    content: "# The Academical Village\n\nMr. Jefferson's academical village not only tended to the minds of its students and faculty but also to their more corporeal needs. While the study of such matters may seem trivial at first glance, it does provide insight into the day-to-day workings of the university, revealing the sometimes contentious relationships between students, faculty, family, servants, and hotelkeepers, and marking the presence of these and other people (and even animals) that traversed the grounds of the academical village.\_\n\n<button content=\"Explore Now\" href=\"#\" color=\"secondary\" text=\"content_light\" />\n"

              ## History of the Village


              The University of Virginia was Thomas Jefferson’s crowning
              architectural achievement. The overall design for Central College,
              based on his 1814 plan for Albemarle Academy, was approved by the
              Board of Visitors of Central College in 1817. The University of
              Virginia was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly on January
              25, 1819, and took over Central College’s assets. At that time,
              two Pavilions (residences for professors as well as classroom
              space), III and VII, were already under construction.


              The pavilions and dormitories were largely complete by 1822.
              Classes began at the University of Virginia on March 7, 1825, with
              five professors and fewer than seventy students. The Rotunda and
              Anatomical Theatre were completed in 1826, after Thomas
              Jefferson’s death on July 4. By that time, the university
              community included eight professors and over 120 students.

              Instead of being built all at once, pavilions, hotels, and
              dormitories were approved for construction as funding became
              available. Thomas Jefferson designed the pavilions in detail as
              they were approved for construction. He based his designs on a
              number of classical models, including those published by Andrea
              Palladio, Fréart de Chambray, and Charles Errard. Each pavilion is
              unique, and Jefferson made his own changes to the models he chose.
              In the spring of 1816, Jefferson wrote to Governor Wilson Cary
              Nicholas about his plans for the design of the pavilions, stating,
              “…more may be said hereafter on the opportunity these small
              buildings will afford, of exhibiting models in architecture of the
              purest forms of antiquity, furnishing to the student examples of
              the precepts he will be taught in that art.”\[1] He made similar
              comments in a letter to craftsman James Dinsmore in April of the
              following year. Jefferson hoped that his design for the Academical
              Village would elevate Virginia architecture and serve as
              inspiration to the young men the school would educate.
