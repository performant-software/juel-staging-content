    content: "# The Academical Village\n\nMr. Jefferson's academical village not only tended to the minds of its students and faculty but also to their more corporeal needs. While the study of such matters may seem trivial at first glance, it does provide insight into the day-to-day workings of the university, revealing the sometimes contentious relationships between students, faculty, family, servants, and hotelkeepers, and marking the presence of these and other people (and even animals) that traversed the grounds of the academical village.\_\n\n<button content=\"Explore Now\" href=\"#\" color=\"secondary\" text=\"content_light\" />\n"

                      ## History of the Village


                      The University of Virginia was Thomas Jefferson’s crowning
                      architectural achievement. The overall design for Central
                      College, based on his 1814 plan for Albemarle Academy, was
                      approved by the Board of Visitors of Central College in
                      1817. The University of Virginia was chartered by the
                      Virginia General Assembly on January 25, 1819, and took
                      over Central College’s assets. At that time, two Pavilions
                      (residences for professors as well as classroom space),
                      III and VII, were already under construction.


                      The pavilions and dormitories were largely complete by
                      1822. Classes began at the University of Virginia on March
                      7, 1825, with five professors and fewer than seventy
                      students. The Rotunda and Anatomical Theatre were
                      completed in 1826, after Thomas Jefferson’s death on July
                      4. By that time, the university community included eight
                      professors and over 120 students.

                      Instead of being built all at once, pavilions, hotels, and
                      dormitories were approved for construction as funding
                      became available. Thomas Jefferson designed the pavilions
                      in detail as they were approved for construction. He based
                      his designs on a number of classical models, including
                      those published by Andrea Palladio, Fréart de Chambray,
                      and Charles Errard. Each pavilion is unique, and Jefferson
                      made his own changes to the models he chose. In the spring
                      of 1816, Jefferson wrote to Governor Wilson Cary Nicholas
                      about his plans for the design of the pavilions, stating,
                      “…more may be said hereafter on the opportunity these
                      small buildings will afford, of exhibiting models in
                      architecture of the purest forms of antiquity, furnishing
                      to the student examples of the precepts he will be taught
                      in that art.”\[1] He made similar comments in a letter to
                      craftsman James Dinsmore in April of the following year.
                      Jefferson hoped that his design for the Academical Village
                      would elevate Virginia architecture and serve as
                      inspiration to the young men the school would educate.

                      ## Student Housing


                      ##### *Lawn, Range, and Monroe Hill Dormitories*


                      The original Academical Village included 108 double
                      occupancy rooms (54 rooms on the Lawn and 54 on Ranges).
                      On the Lawn, student rooms were interspersed with 5
                      Pavilions on both the east and west sides. On the Ranges,
                      student rooms were interspersed with 3 Hotels on both east
                      and west sides. After 1847, additional dormitory space
                      opened just southwest of the Academical Village on Monroe
                      Hill.

                      The Hotels, three each on East and West Ranges, were
                      designed as dining halls that included living space for
                      the independent contractor who rented the dining hall.
                      Students subscribed to an individual hotel for dining and
                      boarding services. Hotelkeepers managed daily meal service
                      as well as student room maintenance, with most work
                      performed by laborers they enslaved. Between 1825 and
                      1865, typically only four hotels were in operation as
                      dining halls at any one moment. The other hotels instead
                      served as student spaces or living space for faculty or
                      administrators.

                      ## Faculty Housing


                      ##### *The Pavilions*


                      Faculty primarily lived in one of the ten Pavilions.
                      Within those domains, the faculty member was the head of a
                      household that included not only his family (most often a
                      spouse and children) but also enslaved domestic servants.
                      Spanning several floors, the professor and his family
                      would live in the main and upper levels while the servants
                      would be housed in the lower-level cellar spaces, an attic
                      garrett, or in adjacent outbuildings. The Pavilion’s main
                      floor was also designated as classroom space during the
                      day. Faculty and their family members did not always dwell
                      solely within one Pavilion or unit. Family members
                      sometimes lived in other Pavilions, in adjacent Lawn
                      rooms, or at off-campus locations.
