    title: About the Project
    subtitle: >-
      JUEL was cofounded by Maurie McInnis, former University of Virginia
      Professor of Art History and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Kirt
      von Daacke, University of Virginia Research Professor (History & American
      Studies), with start-up funding provided by the Jefferson Trust. Site
      development continues today with ongoing generous support from the William
      R. Kenan Endowment Fund of the Academical Village.

              Jefferson’s vision of a secular university, dedicated to enriching
              public life and sustaining the new republic, was both embodied in
              and transformed by the people who lived, worked, and studied at
              the University. Bringing together a trove of personal and
              administrative documents, as well as historic images of the
              university and three-dimensional digital renderings, JUEL invites
              users to discover the people and places of the University’s early
              years, stretching from its founding in 1819 through the end of the
              Civil War. This project, an expansive archive of documents, 3D
              models, and interpretive materials, yields rich historical data
              and also brings to life the Academical Village’s built landscape
              as nineteenth century people would have experienced it.

              The research, creation, and maintenance of the database and
              interpretive framework that comprise JUEL is due to the expertise
              and effort of professors, students, researchers, and staff. Kirt
              von Daacke and Maurie McInnis, the founding principal
              investigators, created the concept for the digital project: an
              archival and visual repository and recreation of the early
              Academical Village. Worthy Martin, then IATH co-director, led the
              design of the project’s original technical architecture and served
              as a principal investigator until his retirement. After Professor
              McInnis left UVA, Louis Nelson joined the team in 2017 as a new
              principal investigator. Ashley Schmidt also joined the team in
              2024 as a principal investigator. Since 2012, dozens of
              undergraduate and graduate students have worked on all aspects of
              the project as researchers, interpreters, writers, and
              technological designers.

      ## Thank you to our generous supporters


      The project would not be possible without the support of a number of
      offices and initiatives, including the Albert and Shirley Small Special
      Collections Library, the “Students of the University of Virginia” project
      by Jean L. Cooper, the research and historical reports prepared for the
      University by Benjamin Ford of Rivanna Archaeological Services, and the
      research data of both the UVA President’s Commission on Slavery and the
      University (PCSU) and President’s Commission on the University in the Age
      of Segregation (PCUAS). Generous funding support has been provided by The
      Jefferson Trust and the William R. Kenan Endowment Fund of the Academical
      Village.
