    title: The People of Jefferson's University
    subtitle: >-
      Explore the people who were part of the university community, from those
      who first envisioned the University, to those who physically constructed
      it, to those who lived, learned, and worked at the school after it opened
      in 1825. The academical village—as an intellectual conceit and
      architectural plan, as a physical locale over a mile outside of
      Charlottesville, and as an actual lived reality—involved architects,
      designers, building contractors, enslaved laborers, wage laborers,
      artisans, faculty and their families, administrators and their families,
      hotelkeepers and their families, students, local residents, and others.

              ##### *Students*


              ## Who attended the university?


              The first day of classes at Jefferson’s university began on March
              7th, 1825, with an inaugural class of 68 (it grew to over 120
              students by the end of the first session). By 1860, almost six
              hundred students were enrolled at what had become the third
              largest college or university in the United States. Who were those
              early students, the first to live and learn in Jefferson’s
              Academical Village?

              ##### *Faculty, Board, and Staff*


              ## Who taught and led the university?


              ##### *Professors and Board of Visitors*


              Key to Jefferson’s vision for enlightened learning in the
              Academical Village were the faculty. From 8 faculty, 3
              administrators and 7 Board members in 1825 to 9 Board members as
              well as 27 professors, lecturers, and administrators by 1860,
              faculty represented the most important educators and
              administrators at the university. The faculty lived with their
              families in Pavilions on the Lawn, taught in classroom spaces
              across the Academical Village, oversaw student academic progress,
              managed all student discipline, and administratively managed all
              aspects of the school’s day-to-day business.

              #### *Free Blacks*


              From the very beginning of construction, wage-earning free Blacks
              played important roles in the building, maintenance, and daily
              functioning of the university. Although never numbering more than
              600 in the surrounding county, they provided a host of support
              services catering to the university community: digging wells,
              maintaining hydraulic systems, working as janitors, washing
              clothes, repairing shoes, mending and tailoring clothes, making
              hats, and so much more.

              #### *The Enslaved*


              Enslaved people were responsible for a significant portion of the
              university’s construction: moving earth, leveling terraces,
              digging clay, making bricks, cutting stone, and blacksmithing.
              After the school opened in 1825, they cooked meals, waited tables,
              cleaned privies, chopped wood, set up and cleaned up after
              laboratory experiments, and also attended to both classrooms and
              student rooms.

              ##### *Hotelkeepers*


              The University of Virginia was a pioneer in outsourcing dining and
              lodging services. From its opening in 1825, the University rented
              “Hotels” (dining halls with living space) to independently
              contracted hotel keepers, who provided meals and room-cleaning
              services for students. Those enslaved by hotelkeepers were
              responsible for cooking and serving meals, laundry, cleaning, and
              general domestic support of students.

              ##### *Merchants*


              Understanding UVA’s early years requires looking beyond the school
              to Charlottesville and Albemarle County. Though bound by rules
              befitting “gentlemen scholars,” students often ventured well
              beyond the Academical Village, frequenting taverns, bookstores,
              and shops. They also patronized a host of local businesses, from
              candy stores and clothiers to barbers and stables. As UVA grew, so
              too did adjacent neighborhoods with stores and businesses run by
              locals catering to students and faculty.
