              ##### *About the Project*


              ## Jefferson’s University - Early Life Project, 1819-1870 (JUEL)


              Jefferson’s vision of a secular university, dedicated to enriching
              public life and sustaining the new republic, was both embodied in
              and transformed by the people who lived, worked, and studied at
              the University. Bringing together a trove of personal and
              administrative documents, as well as archival images of the
              university and three-dimensional digital renderings, JUEL invites
              users to discover the people and places of the University’s early
              years, stretching from its founding in 1819 through the end of the
              Civil War. This project, an expansive archive of documents, 3D
              models, and interpretive materials, yields rich historical data
              and also brings to life the Academical Village’s built landscape
              as nineteenth century people would have experienced it.


              JUEL was cofounded by Maurie McInnis, former University of
              Virginia Professor of Art History and Vice Provost for Academic
              Affairs and Kirt von Daacke, University of Virginia Research
              Professor (History & American Studies), with start-up funding from
              the Jefferson Trust. Site development continues today with ongoing
              generous support from the William R. Kenan Endowment Fund of the
              Academical Village.
