    content: "# The Academical Village\n\nMr. Jefferson's academical village not only tended to the minds of its students and faculty but also to their more corporeal needs. While the study of such matters may seem trivial at first glance, it does provide insight into the day-to-day workings of the university, revealing the sometimes contentious relationships between students, faculty, family, servants, and hotelkeepers, and marking the presence of these and other people (and even animals) that traversed the grounds of the academical village.\_\n\n<button content=\"Explore Now\" href=\"#\" color=\"secondary\" text=\"content_light\" />\n"

              ## Student Housing


              #### Lawn, Range, and Monroe Hill Dormitories


              The original Academical Village included 108 double occupancy
              rooms (54 rooms on the Lawn and 54 on Ranges). On the Lawn,
              student rooms were interspersed with 5 Pavilions on both the east
              and west sides. On the Ranges, student rooms were interspersed
              with 3 Hotels on both east and west sides. After 1847, additional
              dormitory space opened just southwest of the Academical Village on
              Monroe Hill.

              The Hotels, three each on East and West Ranges, were designed as
              dining halls that included living space for the independent
              contractor who rented the dining hall. Students subscribed to an
              individual hotel for dining and boarding services. Hotelkeepers
              managed daily meal service as well as student room maintenance,
              with most work performed by laborers they enslaved. Between 1825
              and 1865, typically only four hotels were in operation as dining
              halls at any one moment. The other hotels instead served as
              student spaces or living space for faculty or administrators.

              ## Faculty Housing


              #### The Pavilions


              Faculty primarily lived in one of the ten Pavilions. Within those
              domains, the faculty member was the head of a household that
              included not only his family (most often a spouse and children)
              but also enslaved domestic servants. Spanning several floors, the
              professor and his family would live in the main and upper levels
              while the servants would be housed in the lower-level cellar
              spaces, an attic garrett, or in adjacent outbuildings. The
              Pavilion’s main floor was also designated as classroom space
              during the day. Faculty and their family members did not always
              dwell solely within one Pavilion or unit. Family members sometimes
              lived in other Pavilions, in adjacent Lawn rooms, or at off-campus
              locations.
