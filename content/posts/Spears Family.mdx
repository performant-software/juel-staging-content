The Spears family, photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 6, 1914 and October 8, 1918.  
  
From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"Mr. and Mrs. Spears lived next to me on Oak Street at 407 Oak Street in 1943. He was an employee at the University of Virginia Hospital. She worked in the cafeteria at the UVA Hospital." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.  

"Peggy Ragland Brown Spears is my Great-Great-Grandmother. Her first husband, Abram (Abraham) Brown died. She remarried Mr. Joe Spears. To connect the lines:   
My father is Clayton Hamilton Brown Sr. > His father is John Clously (Jack) Brown (1910-1992) > His father is Jack Brown (1865-1958) = this is the child of Peggy and Abram." - Ms. DeTeasa B. Gathers, descendent, participanat at Family Photo Day. 

From 2 August 2019, Ms. Gathers notes that [Lillian Brown](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1444# "Brown, Lillian") ([P48618](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48618 "P48618")) and [Marion Brown](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1445 "Brown, Marion") ([P48619](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48619 "P48619")) may be related to Peggy Ragland Brown Spears. 

Additional information about the Spears family will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
