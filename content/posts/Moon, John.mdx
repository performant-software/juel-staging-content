"John Moon," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on November 20, 1914.

In 1902, a John Moon was registered as a qualified voter in Charlottesville's Fourth Ward for the November 1902 election (the first one following the change in Virginia's Constitution, which had disenfranchised many African Americans). The Daily Progress notes, “The Board of Registrars for the fourth ward of the city was comprised of Messrs. Thomas S. Jones, chairman, Roy K. Flannagan and Water Dinwiddie. The board registered during its sitting the following qualified voters": 

"J. Allen, Robt. Bullock, [**A. T. Buckner**](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1190 "Buckner, A. T."), G. W. Brown, Henry Blue, J. W. Burns, Charles Burley, R. T. Brown, J. L. Coles, Wm. E. Catlett, Wm. Dickerson, Robert Flood, Charles Fuller, C. D. Goodloe, Charles Goodloe, \[C\] S. Hooker, Elder Harris, Albert Hooker, Hudson Jenkins, Robert Keller, G. W. Lawson, W. O. Lewis, [**J. E. Moon**](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1533#overlay-context=node/996 "Moon, John E."), J. P. Michie, Thos. Preston, R. C. Quarles, Warner Rivers, Albert Southall, [**B. E. Tonsler**](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1447 "Tonsler, B. E."), Lee Watson, Allen Watson and P. Y. Wyatt" (_The Daily Progress_, October 29, 1902, p. 4).

A John Moon is listed in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database; it may or may not be the same individual as photographed below (although the estimated age of the subject does appear to align with the recorded birth date): "John Henry Moon, born July 1 1898 in Covesville Virginia to Abraham and Emma (Grooms) Moon; spouse Ada; died May 10 1937 in Albemarle County Virginia and buried in Covesville.

The Albemarle County tax records list John Moon in 1899 as an owner of 75 or more acres in Albemarle County ("Landowners").

Note the similarity of the young girl in this photo to that of [Mary Moon](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1736 "Mary Moon") (taken one month later).

Additional information about John Moon will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Moon, John](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042783/full/778,%20561/0/default.jpg "Moon, John")
