Harry, adult male (last name unknown). Owned by [Miss Elizabeth G. Hill](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/862 "Elizabeth G. Hill") ([P47935](/en/people/ba24f9a0-9abe-4f3c-832b-3c734d35b5c9 "P47935")), Harry is listed as a slave, age "45," residing in Rockingham, VA ([PL4879](/en/places/3013e953-a08e-4c32-9515-123939357ebe "PL4879")). He is one 29 total slaves owned by Hill, as documented in, "List of Miss EG Hill's Servants, January 13th 1862."

Harry is also mentioned in an earlier letter from John Staige Davis ([P43680](/en/people/3a14cfdd-ac55-448b-83dc-43261a120517 "P43680")) to James Crawford, dated December 17, 1861. In it, he urges Crawford to consider hiring two of Hill's servants, Harry and [John](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/890 "John") ([P47957](/en/people/1b6bb172-6ef8-49dc-ac92-8e3db5d92052 "P47957")):

"I hope you will not consider Miss Hill too urgent in applying again for the hires of her servants, Harry & John, now due nearly twelve months. She is in much need of the money."
