"Edwin Jefferson," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 24, 1918.    
  
An Edwin Jefferson is mentioned in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database; it may or may not be the same person as photographed by Holsinger (yet to be determined): "Edward G. Fountain Jefferson," born August 6, 1905 in Albemarle City, Virginia to parents Harry Jefferson and Nancy Quarles; died February 13, 1993. 

A portrait of a woman of the same last name, entitled [Ada Jefferson](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1811 "Jefferson, Ada"), was also taken on the same date; the two may be related, although more information is needed to verify).

Additional information about Edwin Jefferson will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._ ![Jefferson, Edwin](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049920/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Jefferson, Edwin")
