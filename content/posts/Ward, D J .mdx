"D. J. Ward," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 8, 1917. 

The _Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15_ lists "Ward, David J." in the "cleaning and pressing business," working at 235 W Main (p207). Note in the 1918 ad (below) Ward had moved his business to 291 West Main Street.

Other businesses/owners photographed by Holsinger include [Acme Shaving Parlor](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/2164 "Acme Shaving Parlor Ad"), [William F. and Charles H. Brown](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1186 "William F. and Charles H. Brown") (Brown Barber Shop), [A. T. Buckner](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1190 "Buckner, A. T.") (and son George F. Buckner, grocers), [George Carr's Second Hand Clothing](https://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1127 "George Carr's Second Hand Clothing"), [Dr. George F. Ferguson](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1129 "Dr. George R. Ferguson"), [Dr. George R. Johnson](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1216 "Dr. Johnson"), [Mr. J. P. Hawkins](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1307 "Mr. J.P. Hawkins"), [W. G. Layne](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1504 "W. G. Layne") (Layne and Whitlock, Wheelright/Blacksmith), [J.F. Taylor](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/2180 "J.F. Taylor"), and [D. J. Ward](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1530 "D.J. Ward").

Ward often advertized in the Daily Progress, as can also be seen in the 1917 issue below (Daily Progress, September 14, 1917). Ads for Acme Shaving Parlor, J. F. Bell's Funeral Home, and other "colored businesses" often appeared on the same page (below). The complexities for African Americans operating businesses in the Jim Crow period is perhaps best seen, literally, in looking at the full page of the above ads, which includes a "mammy" cariacature in the regularly posted comic strip, "Scoop." See "[Freedman's Tally](https://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/freedoms-tally-african-american-business-jim-crow-south "\"Freedman's Tally\"")" for more information about African Americans operating businesses in the Jim Crow Era.

He was also part of a committee that organized a "splendid farewell for colored men" at First Baptist Church, Charlottesville (27 October 1917, reported in _Daily Progress_) (First Baptist Church: Records of Members Who Served).

See also the photograph of "[Mrs. D. J. Ward](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1531 "Ward, Mrs. D. J.")," produced on the same date. 

Additional information about D. J. Ward will be added as it is researched.
