"Mahuda Farrar," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 12, 1918.

While Mahuda Farrar was not known to be buried at the Daughters of Zion Cemetery, several individuals with the Farrar surname are believed to be interred there: **James Alexander Farrar**, Jesse L. Farrar, Julia Howard Farrar, Rebecca Farrar, and Thomas Farrar (Burial List, 16 July 2019).  

James A. Farrar was listed as a barber working at 112 5th N E in 1914-15 (Charlottesville City Directory). 

Additional information about Mahuda Farrar will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._

The portrait below is a standard studio portrait (X06568A):
