Alexander Garrett was the Bursar of the University of Virginia from 1825 to 1851. In this position he held from the university's start, he was part of early transactions in hiring slaves, as detailed in the Proctor's Daybook:  
  

*   "Bills payable to Dr. A. Garrett, Bursar, for a draft for the payment of the hire of [Peter](/en/people/e088b846-e933-40e5-a7e8-475d95870a7b "Peter") ([P47534](/en/people/e088b846-e933-40e5-a7e8-475d95870a7b "P47534")) for 2 years Bonds taken in - $98.25" (February 5, 1827)

In letters to John Hartwell Cocke ([P43616](/en/people/c61406c9-c83a-4b8b-a093-dccb219d16cb "John Hartwell Cocke")), Garrett also refers to slaves in his possession. In a March 12, 1828 letter, for instance, Garrett writes, "Recollecting your kind offer to give me some of your variety of peaches and supposing this a good time to set them out, I send [Harry](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/662 "Harry") [(P47926)](/en/people/d2af67fe-7ce3-444c-a833-801a1a94a185) for such as you can with convenience spare."
