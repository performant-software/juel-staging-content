"Elizabeth Johnson," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 11, 1912.

An Elizabeth Johnson is listed in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database; it may or may not be the same individual as photographed below: "Annie Elizabeth Johnson, born June 27 1899 in Albemarle County Virginia to parents General & Ella Scott (nee Banks); spouse Henry Johnson; died April 6, 1959 in Charlottesville Virginia and buried in Lincoln Cemetery; son General Johnson and daguthers Catherine Ransno and Elizabeth Monroe." More information is needed to determine if this record is for the woman photographed by Holsinger.

Additional information about Elizabeth Johnson will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
