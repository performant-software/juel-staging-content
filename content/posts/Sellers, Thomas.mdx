"Thomas Sellers," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on February 07, 1919.

Information about Thomas J. Sellers, who started the African-American newspaper, _The Charlottesville Reflector_, can be found [here](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/reflector/sellers.html "Thomas J, Sellers"). More research is needed to determine the possible relation between the infant photographed below and the founder of the paper, Thomas J.

Additional information about Thomas Sellers will be added as it is researched.

NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Sellers, Thomas](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1050566/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Sellers, Thomas")
