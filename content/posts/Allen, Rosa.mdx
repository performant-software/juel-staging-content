"Rosa Allen," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on October 16, 1918.

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database lists a Rosa Allen; it may or may not be the same individual as the one photographed below: "Rosa Elaine Allen, born April 25, 1894 in Albemarle County Virginia to parents Daniel Scott and Letitia Wimbush; died October 24, 1990 in Albemarle County and buried in Chestnut Grove Baptist Cemetery. Husband Howard Allen, daughter Dorothy Ford of Charlottesville, Virginia, and sister Flossie Terrell." More information is needed to confirm the identity. 

Additional information about Rosa Allen will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
