Agnes (last name unknown), female. Owned by [Miss Elizabeth G. Hill](/en/people/ba24f9a0-9abe-4f3c-832b-3c734d35b5c9 "Elizabeth G. Hill") ([P47935](/en/people/ba24f9a0-9abe-4f3c-832b-3c734d35b5c9 "P47935")), Agnes is named in two items in the John Staige Davis Papers: "List of Miss EG Hill's Servants" (January 13, 1862) and "Deed of Sale of Agnes to John Staige Davis" (August 14, 1862). In the former, Agnes is listed under Albemarle County, VA ([PL5392](/en/places/41f5229a-eeef-44b8-a368-ea04e4cf81f9 "PL5392")), aged "27?", one of 29 slaves total. In the latter, Hill deeds to faculty member Davis ([P43680](/en/people/3a14cfdd-ac55-448b-83dc-43261a120517 "P43680")) the slave Agnes, "about 26," as well as her four children: [Randall](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/865 "Randall") "aged 6 years" ([P47936](/en/people/6a067bf8-737a-48c3-935f-6a31e4e2d4b5 "P47936")), [Peggy](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/866 "Peggy") "aged 4 years" ([P47937](/en/people/b9a61a97-789a-4bc2-b9ea-09fe395a8b3c "P47937")), [Jarratt](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/867 "Jarratt") "aged 2 and a half years" ([P47938](/en/people/7aa0d287-02ab-41c5-b417-53388632b598 "P47938")), and an [infant boy](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/868 "Infant Boy ") "aged eight months" ([P47939](/en/people/3a4bfc30-3707-4edc-a94a-60caa0b04acf "P47939")).

Interestingly, Agnes is also mentioned in an earlier letter, dated January 17, 1860. Davis writes to H. B. Bibb, Esq. ([P47976](/en/people/3424a075-e6f6-477b-84a4-cc19719a0482 "P47976")) about his finding a "suitable home" for Agnes. It appears from the letter that Hill and Davis both have some kind of ownership position over Agnes, and that Bibb was to procure employment for her. The full transcript of the letter is found [here](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/343?doc=/juel_display/Cadavers/JS_Davis/Bibb_1860_01_17 "Davis to Bibb, 1860").
