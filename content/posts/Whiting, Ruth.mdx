Her maiden name is Whiting (it's unknown at this time if she was married and if so whether she had changed her surname). What is known of Ruth Whiting thus far is from the May 19, 1867 letter her mother Sally wrote to Nannie C. Minor (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48204" title="P48204">P48204</a>), the relation of Professor John Barbee Minor (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=22874" title="P22874">P22874</a>). Sally wrote from her place of employment at the home of Mrs. Allen Williams (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48930" title="P48930">P48930</a>) in Berryville (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=4247" title="PL4247">PL4247</a>), Clarke County Virginia.</p><p>In the letter, Sally details how an injury has rendered her right hand and foot paralysed and that her daughter Ruth (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=49036" target="_blank" title="P49036">P49036</a>)&nbsp;is herself burdened with her own children, and so asks Nannie whether she may live with her or whether she can provide any assistance:</p><blockquote><p>I took care of you, Miss Nannie, when you were weak &amp;&nbsp;helpless &amp;&nbsp;now you must take care of old Aunt Sally. –&nbsp;that is if the Lord has blessed you with enough&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;to spare. I&nbsp;would love to spend (p.3)&nbsp;the rest of my days with you, - I w[oul]d try to make&nbsp;myself useful in any little ways I could. – but I do feel very&nbsp;helpless out on the world – Ruth can barely take care of herself&nbsp;and her children, and I do feel that I am a heavy [burden?] on her.</p></blockquote><p>She ends the letter by imploring, "Now dear Miss Nannie please write to your Old Nanny and Humble Servant, Sally Whiting."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PRIMARY SOURCE INFORMATION</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1.
