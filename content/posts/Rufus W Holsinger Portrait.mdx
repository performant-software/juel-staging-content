"Rufus W. Holsinger," a photograph taken by the Rufus W. Holsinger studio, date unknown (the University of Virginia Library Catalogue lists the date as 1889/~1930). 

The photograph shows twelve men and young boys; two of them are African American. The man seated at the steering wheel is Rufus W. Holsinger. The library catalogue includes the caption, "(With car), West Main Street."   
  
Some details within the photograph provide useful information. The drug store signage visible in the picture says, "Drug Store 723 \[West Main\]", which was close to Holsinger's studio (at 719-721 West Main). At 727 West Main is "Pitzer's Pool and Billiards Parlor"; the poster in the storefront window provides a rough date for the photo of 1904: "Albemarle Horse Show, August 3 & 4 1904."

This photograph is included here in that, although not a posed studio portrait of African Americans, it shows everyday occurences in Charlottesville, or actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play. It is highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment.  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
