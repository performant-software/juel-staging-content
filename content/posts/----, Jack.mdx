In this position, particularly during the years of the academical village's construction, he was frequently part of early transactions in hiring slaves, as detailed in his own records in the Proctor's Daybook. Most of the transactions detail his hiring slaves on behalf of the university, while some record payments to overseers involved in procuring slaves for labor. Numerous entries were recorded in his Daybook from 1822 through 1827, involving the slaves <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/688" title="Aaron">Aaron</a>&nbsp;(1826-7), <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/684" title="Davey">Davey</a> (1823, 1825-7), <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/690" title="Dick">Dick</a>&nbsp;(1827), "hands" (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=931" title="BROCKENBROUGH'S HANDS">CB0931</a>)&nbsp;(1825), "<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/685" title="Harry">Harry of A.

In Session 5 of the Chairman's Journal, October 11, 1828, the following information can be found:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span class="personname">"Dr. Emmet<span class="personKey"><a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P43625" target="new">(P43625)</a></span></span>&nbsp;complained that he was unable to have the services of&nbsp;<span class="personname">Jack<span class="personKey"><a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P47547" target="new">(P47547)</a></span></span>&nbsp;to clean out his Laboratory when he wished in consequence his being employed, according to Jack’s statement, in private personal attendance in&nbsp;<span class="personname">Dr. Johnson<span class="personKey"><a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P43633" target="new">(P43633)</a></span></span>.

Dr Johnson has presently expressed a wish to have the services of Jack for the use of the Anat. Hall and for his own private use, he paying half the hire. I have always told him no arrangement of the sort could be entered into until Jack’s place could be filled in attending on the Rotunda Lecture Rooms and Library -&nbsp;A Brockenbrough.
