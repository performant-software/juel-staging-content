Anon0008, a "small negro boy," is mentioned in the Chairman's Journals of March 3, 1836:

"I was informed to day by Mr. Penci ([P43877](/en/people/5a1521ff-f4cc-4da9-a521-86f8b1ecad76#m1 "P43877")) that the servants in the University are in the habit of furnishing expensive suppers to the students; & that a small negro boy ([P46981](/en/people/eb39b1d7-2793-4aa2-a38a-e100b3ffc1af#m1 "P46981")) who is often going about selling apples to the students, frequently carries breakfast to their rooms, in his covered basket, which I supposed contained nothing but apples. This boy belonging to no one in the University, but living with a free woman ([P44621](/en/people/a26651d4-f6c3-4b84-a9dd-952d7ad2b116 "P44621")), the wife of Dr. Magill's ([P43655](/en/people/fa3a144d-1284-47dd-ad2a-b3a832d2c7b8#m1 "P43655")) servant ([P44622](/en/people/cbc35bd1-7ac8-4954-a5fe-02ae96b21bd5 "P44622")), in the basement of Mr. Roger's ([P43658](/en/people/58ed7fa3-f0b0-44b6-b238-0da5b0454c97#m1 "P43658")) house \[Pavilion VI, [PL8458](/en/places/70d6c0f1-af07-4ad4-8e4f-eeeb2adabd55#m1 "PL8458")\], I had him sent out of the University immediately."
