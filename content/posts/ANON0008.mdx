<p></p>
<p>"I was informed to day by Mr.&nbsp;<span class="personname">Penci&nbsp;(<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43877#m1" target="_blank" title="P43877">P43877</a>)&nbsp;</span>that the servants in the&nbsp;<span class="cbname">University&nbsp;</span>are in the habit of furnishing expensive suppers to the students; &amp; that a small negro boy (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=46981#m1" title="P46981">P46981</a>)&nbsp;who is often going about selling apples to the students, frequently carries breakfast to their rooms, in his covered basket, which I supposed contained nothing but apples. This boy belonging to no one in the&nbsp;<span class="cbname">University</span>, but living with a free woman (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=44621" title="P44621">P44621</a>), the wife of Dr.&nbsp;<span class="personname">Magill's&nbsp;(<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43655#m1" target="_blank" title="P43655">P43655</a>)&nbsp;</span>servant (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=44622" title="P44622">P44622</a>), in the basement of Mr.&nbsp;<span class="personname">Roger's&nbsp;(<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43658#m1" target="_blank" title="P43658">P43658</a>)&nbsp;</span>house [Pavilion VI,&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8458#m1" target="_blank" title="PL8458">PL8458</a>],&nbsp;I had him sent out of the&nbsp;<span class="cbname">University&nbsp;</span>immediately."</p>
