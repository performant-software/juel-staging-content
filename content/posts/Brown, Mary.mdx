"Mary Brown," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on May 9, 1917. Note that one photograph is labelled, "Dora Mansfield."  
 

Note that the Library Catalog entry for the portrait states, "see also [Dora Mansfield](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1551 "Mansfield, Dora")," a portrait taken on the same date. The relation between the two subjects is not yet known.

  
Additional information about Mary Brown / Dora Mansfield will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
