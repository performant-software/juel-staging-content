Amelia Spinner, photographed by Rufus W. Holsinger.  
  
Amelia Spinner, depicted in a Holsinger portrait dated May 9, 1914. Daughter of Jesse and Nora (Banks) Spinner. Approximately 19 years old at time of photo. On February 28, 1917 married Charles Clarence Wayland (son of Lewis and Nannie Goodloe Wayland). 

From the 1914-15 Charlottesville City Directory: "Spinner Amelia maid Rugby Rd, h Preston Heights" (p172) 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._

Death notice for her husband, Charles Clarence Wayland:

\*Still to be determined: whether Amelia Spinner is related to [William Spinner](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/402 "SPINNER, WILLIAM") (P43844) (UVA's first employed janitor).
