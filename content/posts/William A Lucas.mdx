<p>William A. Lucas (1800-1877) was born in Jefferson County, Virginia, where he grew up and eventually studied at the Tucker Law School. He served in both the Virginia House of Delegates and the US House of Representatives as a Democrat. Lucas primarily occupied himself with horticultural and legal pursuits and served on the Board of Visitors from 1851-1855. His home, Rion Hall, was famous in Jefferson County for its Greek revival design and classically federal nature. It remains one of the prevalent landmarks in the lower Shenandoah valley.&nbsp;</p>
