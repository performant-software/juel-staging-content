Untitled (Dr. Johnson), photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on April 29, 1912.

Comments from Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"This is Dr. Johnson. He had an office on 4th St in a building that's still standing - it's a house for the homeless now. Two black doctors lived next door to each other - the other doctor's name was Dr. Jackson - he was a dentist. Dr. Johnson would come around to your house - he was a family practitioner." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.  

Dr. George R. Johnson was listed in the Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 as a doctor working from an office located at 115 4th N W ([PL9573](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=9573 "PL9573")) (p. 209).
