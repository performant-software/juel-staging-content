<p>JUEL ID/KEY:&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=49014" target="_blank" title="P49014">P49014</a></p><p>"Mattie Jones," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on April 27, 1914.</p><p>Another Holsinger portrait from the same date is of <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1958" target="_blank" title="Jones, Folley">Folley Jones</a>. The ID for the Folley Jones portrait is X02256A, while the ID for the Mattie Jones portrait is X02257A. The sequential nature of the IDs (which were assigned based on how the portraits were recorded in the business ledgers), the near-identical poses, and&nbsp;the women having the same last name, suggests that the two came in together to have their portraits taken. At present, the relationship between the two women is unknown; more research needs to be done.</p><p>Additional information about Mattie Jones will be added as it is researched.&nbsp;</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</em>&nbsp;<img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042046/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg" alt="Jones, Mattie" title="Jones, Mattie" width="1000" height="1337" /><br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1042046#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0" target="_blank" title="Jones, Mattie">Mattie Jones</a>," 1914-04-27 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X02257A)&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
