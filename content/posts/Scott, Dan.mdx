"Dan Scott," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 15, 1918.

A photograph of [Ida Scott](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1446 "Scott, Ida") was also taken on July 15, 1918 (with the ID X06468A; the Dan Scott portrait ID is X06467A). Based on their having the same last name, the same date and the consecutive order of the IDs (as entered in Holsinger's ledger), it is highly likely Dan and Ida came together to the portrait studio (although they were not photographed together in one portrait). The relationship between the two individuals is not yet known.

Additional information about Dan Scott will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Scott, Dan](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049430/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Scott, Dan")
