Jefferson School football team, photographed by Ralph Holsinger (date unknown, but no earlier than 1926, when the building below was constructed). [Click here](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/2165 "Jefferson School") to learn more about the Jefferson School buildings.

Note there are two photographs total, which are duplicates of one another (photo Y21177B2 is shown below).

Most subjects on the team (known at the time as the "Red Devils") have been identified, as per the UVA Library Catalogue (the catalogue entry notes the identifications are courtesy of Teresa Price, a former teacher and native of Charlottesville): 

"Starting from the front left hand: 1. Charles L. Jackson 2. Lloyd Quarterman 3. Billy "Goat" Lewis 4. John Locket 5. William "Shortie" Brown 6. Carter "Red" Wicks 7. Earl "Cap" Fortune 8. Alfred Bynum 9. Bernard Dabney. 

Second row from left hand: 10. DuBois Johnson 11. Raleigh Kelly 12. William Cox Jackson 13. Charles "Chink" Lee 14. Grover Henderson 15. Carl Johnson 16. Phillip Sellers 17. Carol Allen. 

Last row from left hand: 18. Nannie Henderson 19. Thomas Martin 20. Edward McCreavy 21. Beverly "Pep" Thomas Standing from left hand: 22. Dr. Edward W. Stratton, Team Physician 23. Mr. James "Wop" Edgar, Coach." 

This photograph is included here in that, although not a posed studio portrait of African Americans, it shows everyday occurences in Charlottesville, or actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play or, in this instance, show African Americans in their own domain (whether before their home, in social groups, etc.) It is highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment. 

More information about the subjects in the photograph will be added as it is found.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._ Y21177B2:
