Keziah Fortune, "a free black woman," is described in the October 30, 1830 entry of the Chairman's Journal. Likely the "Mr. Rose" being referred to in this entry is the hotelkeeper, John N. Rose ([P43866](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43866#m1 "P43866")), who at this time managed Hotel F ([PL8437](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8437#m1 "PL8437")). Although "referred to the Proctor," the incident is not brought up again. 

"The Assistant Proctor informed me, that a Free Black Woman, named Keziah Fortune, of bad character, was living with the precincts without being under the control of any particular master. She washes for Mr. Rose. By a law of the Faculty, she cannot be permitted to remain, and Mr. Rose called to mention that her immediate removal would cause him very serious inconvenience. The whole matter was referred to the Proctor."
