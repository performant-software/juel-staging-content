"Tal Washington," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on November 30, 1918.

Note that the pins on his lapel are an American flag and a colored cross on a white background (similar to the Red Cross logo in shape). 

The gentleman in this photo is also seen in an earlier portrait taken January 4, 1913, labelled "[Tillie Washington](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1933 "Washington, Tillie")." The subject, however, looks to be about the same age, and even is very similarly dressed, in both photos. Likely there was an error in transcribing the date (1918/1913) and name.

Additional information about Tal/ Tillie Washington will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
