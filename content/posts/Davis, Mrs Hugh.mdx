"Mrs. Hugh Davis," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on December 22, 1914.

Of interest in the photograph is the unidentified African American woman (likely the nurse/nanny) supporting the child. The whitened portion of negative is possibly an alteration done to edit out or remove the woman's hands from the infant's dress. The woman looks similar to [Cora Walker](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1904 "Cora Walker") (but the identity of the woman can't be verified).  
  
Photos of the nurse and/or infant are common in this time period, and Holsinger took several (see for instance, [Mrs. W. B. Forsythe](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1655 "Forsythe, Mrs. W. B."), [U. H. Magee](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/2020 "Magee, U. H."), [Mr. Trotter](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1325 "Mr. Trotter"), [J. E. Shepherd](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1922 "J. E. Shepherd"), [Margaret Lewis/Mrs. Shepherd](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1323 "Margaret Lewis / Mrs. Shepherd")). 

Additional information about Mrs. Hugh Davis will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Davis, Mrs. Hugh](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042920/full/561,778/0/default.jpg "Davis, Mrs. Hugh")
