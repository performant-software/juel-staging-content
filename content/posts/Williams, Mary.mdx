"Mary Williams," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on December 23, 1918.

Note that the woman's hat features an eagle insignia. It may relate to an official organization, or, may just be showing the miliatary influence on fashion in this time period.

The young woman below may be the same Mary Williams mentioned in several sources. The 1910 Charlottesville Census mentions a Mary Williams who was born in 1910. Also, The "Papers of the Clark family, 1925-1993," contains accounts of Mary Clark Cooper Williams Stanley, 1901-1991, and her brother, George Albert Clark, 1910-1992, of Charlottesville.

Additional information about Mary Williams will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
