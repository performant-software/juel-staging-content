"S. W. Gill," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on July 16, 1913.

The UVA Library Catalogue describes the image as showing a porch with a machine for sorting apples. Of interest is the young African American boy standing to the right of the apparatus; he appears to be demonstrating the operation of the machine for the five men standing alongside him,.

Additional information about S. W. Gill will be added as it is researched.  
_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._ ![Gill, S. W.](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1041294/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Gill, S. W.")
