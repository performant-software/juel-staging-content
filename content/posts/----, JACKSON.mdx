Jackson (last name unknown), adult male. Jackson is described in a Chairman's Journal entry dated October 5, 1863 as a "negro having a white wife" who lived on grounds: "Instructed Mr. Wm. A Pratt [(P43770)](/en/people/5248e3ed-1baa-4e37-a295-43f5547c2eca#m1 "P43770"), Suptdr. of Grounds [(PL8688)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=PL8688) & Buildings [(PL8638)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=PL8638) to remove Jackson [(P47281)](/en/people/cfc42e19-46b1-45fe-85fb-44269b34941d), a negro having a white wife, from the House he occupied on the University grounds [(PL8688)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=PL8688)."
