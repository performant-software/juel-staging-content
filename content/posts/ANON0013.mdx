Anon0013, a "free woman of colour," is mentioned in the Chairman's Journals of June 3, 1834:

"Received information that Misters R.M. Head ([P34264](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=34264 "P34264")) - J.S. Peebles ([P37627](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=37627 "P37627")) - T.L. Patterson ([P32066](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=32066 "P32066")) - & W. Wallace ([P29853](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=29853 "P29853")) were drunk on the night of the 22nd of May: that on the night in question they came to the farm which lies to the north of the University ([PL8511](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8511#m1 "PL8511")), and in the property of Professor Blaetterman ([P43621](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43621 "P43621")): went to the house rented by Professor Blaetterman to Barnet[](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/114?doc=/db/JUEL/chairman/vol_5/Vol_005_0121_0180.xml&keyword1=barnet#m2)t - were intoxicated - Mr. Peebles the most so: had been to the spring below Smith's, where witness understood they had been drinking. Witness, who was a free woman of colour, described the establishment of Barnett's as a brothel: - students came there every night: - had threatened her life, under the idea that she gave information, (I had received none before from this source, she now came voluntarily).

Sent for Misters Head, Peebles, Patterson and Wallace: the latter denied having been at the party; was further cleared of any participation by the testimony of Head, who being informed that I should adhere to my charge against himself, admitted that he had sufficient connection with the party who drank at the spring, to know that Wallace was not there. 

Dismissed Mr. Wallace's case, and summoned the others to appear before the Faculty."
