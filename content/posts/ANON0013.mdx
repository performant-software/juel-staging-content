<p>Anon0013, a "free woman of colour," is mentioned in the Chairman's Journals of June 3, 1834:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Received information that Misters&nbsp;R.M. Head (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=34264" title="P34264">P34264</a>)&nbsp;-&nbsp;J.S. Peebles (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=37627" title="P37627">P37627</a>)&nbsp;-&nbsp;T.L. Patterson (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=32066" title="P32066">P32066</a>)&nbsp;- &amp;&nbsp;W. Wallace (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=29853" title="P29853">P29853</a>)&nbsp;were drunk on the night of the&nbsp;22nd of May: that on the night in question they came to&nbsp;the farm which lies to the north of the University (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8511#m1" title="PL8511">PL8511</a>), and in the property of&nbsp;Professor Blaetterman (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43621" title="P43621">P43621</a>): went to the house rented by Professor Blaetterman to <span class="highlight">Barnet<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/114?doc=/db/JUEL/chairman/vol_5/Vol_005_0121_0180.xml&amp;keyword1=barnet#m2"></a></span>t - were intoxicated - Mr. Peebles the most so: had been to the spring below Smith's, where witness understood they had been drinking. Witness, who was a free woman of colour, described the establishment of <span class="highlight">Barnet</span>t's as a brothel: - students came there every night: - had threatened her life, under the idea that she gave information, (I had received none before from this source, she now came voluntarily).</p>
<p>Sent for Misters&nbsp;Head,&nbsp;Peebles,&nbsp;Patterson and&nbsp;Wallace: the latter denied having been at the party; was further cleared of any participation by the testimony of Head, who being informed that I should adhere to my charge against himself, admitted that he had sufficient connection with the party who drank at the spring, to know that Wallace was not there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dismissed Mr. Wallace's case, and summoned the others to appear before the Faculty."</p>
