"Joe Henderson," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 17, 1914.

An entry in the 1910 Census about a Joseph Henderson may be the same individual as photographed below: "Joseph Henderson; 12, male, mulatto; can read, write, and attended school the previous year; house number 315; family number 226; residing at Gospel Hill Street." The age of the boy mentioned in the 1910 Census does seem to match the apparent age/appearance of Joe Henderson, photographed below; more information is needed, however, to verify.

Additional information about the subject photographed will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
