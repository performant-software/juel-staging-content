Holsinger taken on February 3, 1917.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that this portrait shows the young men dressed in worker's clothing. It was not uncommon in this time period to choose to depict oneself in one's work clothing and with accessories/tools of the trade when sitting for a photo, known as "occupational portraits" (Finefield) (for an example, see&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1206" target="_blank" title="Lightfoot, James">James Lightfoot</a>).&nbsp;This portrait, however, gives no indication of the work of the individuals below, and so technically is not an occupational portrait, per se: he is dressed in generic laborer's clothing that do not specifically indicate his profession.&nbsp;Perhaps, then, he simply came in to have his portrait taken in the clothing he was wearing at that time.&nbsp;Whether purposefully showcasing his occupation or not (choosing to be photographed "as is"), it is an interesting act of self-representation.</p><p>From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019:&nbsp;</p><p>"These were brothers who worked on the Southern railroad."- Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day. &nbsp;</p><p>Additional information about Will Smith will be added as it is researched.<br /><span style="font-size: small;"><i><br />NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</i></span><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1045032/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg" alt="Smith, Will" title="Smith, Will" width="1000" height="1337" /><br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1045032#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=-1282%2C0%2C5315%2C3940" target="_blank" title="Smith, Will">Will Smith</a>," 1917-02-03 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X04800A)&nbsp;</span></p><p>- printed notes, flipbook vol. 6.2&nbsp;</p><p>- comments from Family Photo Day courtesy Mr. Melvin Flannagan, Jr.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
