"Dr. George R. Ferguson," three photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on February 22, 1917 and July 7, 1915. (See also the portrait of Dr. Ferguson labelled, "[Miss Sattie Butler](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1544 "Butler, Miss Sattie").")

Dr. Ferguson was an African-American physician in the 1900's. Photographed by Holsinger with his children George ([P48614](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48614 "P48614")) and Louise ([P49208](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=49208 "P49208")) on February 22, 1917 and July 7, 1915 (see entry on George Jr.). He's been described as the first African American physician to have a long-time practice in Albemarle County. A graduate of Howard University, he was described in a 1933 "national medical journal" as, "'the beloved physician' who 'was gentle, modest, friendly to all, and easily approached by the most lowly'" (Starr Hills Heritage Trails). 

From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"This is Dr. Ferguson - he was one of those home physicians. Back then, it was against the law to have a white doctor come to a black person's house, so the person who needs the doctor would have to call him. If he was out of town, you were in bad luck. His son (pictured here), George Ferguson became an undertaker and his last office was on Ridge Street at the funeral home \[possibly Hill & Wood Funeral home, Charlottesville?\]. He was president of the NAACP." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day. 

From August 2, 2019: 

"The girl is sister of George, Jr. and named Louise. George Ferguson, Jr. the undertaker with Louise Ferguson." - Ms. Teresa Price.

Fortunately, George Ferguson Jr. was interviewed in 1980; the audio of the interview, as well as a transcript, can be found here: ¨[Interview of George Ferguson \[Jr.\] by Milton J. Carpenter on December 15, 1980](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/orals/gferguson.html "Interview of George Ferguson, 1980").¨

Dr. Ferguson's office was located at 307 West Main Street, as listed in the _Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15_ (below). Dr. Ferguson signed death certificates for many individuals buried at the Daughters of Zion cemetery; George Jr. was in charge of funeral arrangements for several burials.

According to the Starr Hill Heritage Trails Map: 

> After nearly twenty years at 307 West Main, Dr. Ferguson moved around 1929 to 206 Sixth Street NW. He saw patients in the lower level office. Son George R. Ferguson had a funeral home and was president of the Charlottesville NAACP. Granddaughter Olivia Ferguson was one of the Charlottesville Twelve, who led the 1959 desegregation of city schools. This duplex \[206 Sixth St NW\] was home and office for three African American doctors. After Dr. Ferguson died in 1932, Dr. Edward W. Stratton was here until 1940. Dr. Marshall T. Garrett then lived and practiced here until moving to 320 West Main just before 1950.
