"Mr. Yancey," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on December 21, 1915.

The photographs (duplicates) depict the deceased subject prepared for the funeral, a common practice in the late nineteenth- and early twentieth centuries. Note the funerary wreaths read, from left to right, "Daughters of Elks," "My Husband," "Friends."

Additional information about Mr. Yancey will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
