Untitled (portrait of an infant), a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on December 27, 1918.

Photographs were labelled in Holsinger's ledgers by the name of the person whom paid for the portrait; in this instance, no name is associated (perhaps an error in transcribing Holsinger's written ledgers, or, perhaps the writing was illegible for that entry).

Note that a portrait from the same date labelled, "[Stuart Fuller](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1198 "Fuller, Stuart")" also shows an infant, and has the antecedent ID (X07229A). Perhaps the children were from the same family and were photographed at the same time; additional information is needed, however, to determine if the two subjects are related. 

The identity of, and additional information about, the infant will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Untitled infant (X07230A)](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1050374/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Untitled infant (X07230A)")
