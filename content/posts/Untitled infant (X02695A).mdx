Untitled (portrait of an infant), a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 10, 1914.

Photographs were labelled in Holsinger's ledgers by the name of the person whom paid for the portrait; in this instance, no name is associated (perhaps an error in transcribing Holsinger's written ledgers, or, perhaps the writing was illegible for that entry). 

From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"These are the Smith twins - this picture was taken during World War One."- Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.  

\*Note: the image is labelled "untitled" in the Holsinger catalogue, and so can't be found if searching by the name "Smith" (use ID #X02695A).

The identity of, and additional information about, the infant will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Untitled infant](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042623/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Untitled infant (X02695A)")
