"George Blue," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on September 23, 1918.

A George Blue of Stony Point is listed in the Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 (p.238).

It is not yet known whether George is related to [Lucy Blue](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1192 "Blue, Lucy") (also photographed by Holsinger in 1918).

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home database lists a "George Washington Blue," born July 7, 1881 and died August 30, 1931; he was married to an Eliza Jane Blue and was buried in Stony Point, VA." Given the age of George Washington Blue, it would seem the subject below is perhaps a son? 

  
Additional information about George Blue will be added as it is researched.  
  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
