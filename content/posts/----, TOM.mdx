Tom (last name unknown), adult male, is mentioned in the Chairman's Journal of 1829 (Session 6). The December 29, 1829 entry states, "The Proctor ([P43627](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43627 "P43627")) contacted the Chairman ([P43624](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43624 "P43624")) regarding the permitting of Tom, a servant of Mr. Rose ([P43866](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43866 "P43866")) to inhabit the cellars of one of the Hotels. It was considered right to refuse him." At the time (1829), Mr. Rose was the Hotelkeeper of Hotel F ([PL8437](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8437#m1 "PL8437")).
