Tom (last name unknown), adult male, is mentioned in the Chairman's Journal of 1829 (Session 6). The December 29, 1829 entry states, "The Proctor ([P43627](/en/people/3cf66e55-3c68-473d-b75d-566f5acb7b79 "P43627")) contacted the Chairman ([P43624](/en/people/f4611856-1ec5-42c1-9d79-b0cec3bd17b1 "P43624")) regarding the permitting of Tom, a servant of Mr. Rose ([P43866](/en/people/201889ef-5330-4cf2-b2c6-35d7bf311b96 "P43866")) to inhabit the cellars of one of the Hotels. It was considered right to refuse him." At the time (1829), Mr. Rose was the Hotelkeeper of Hotel F ([PL8437](/en/places/953a23cd-0548-41dc-8888-f35cfd231379#m1 "PL8437")).
