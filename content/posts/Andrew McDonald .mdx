<p>Andrew McDonald of Monongalia, WV, served on the Board of Visitors from 1851-1854. Not much is known about McDonald, but did serve as a foot soldier in the Revolutionary War. There is also an account about McDonald while he served as a Monongalia County delegate. After giving a speech which criticized a case against Jordan Hatcher, he was attacked near the Washington Hotel by some who disliked his comments. The Jordan Hatcher case illustrated the continual struggle between master and slave in antebellum Virginia, as well as the unjust treatment of &quot;insubordinate&quot; slaves in Virginia court.</p>
