"Mrs. Bezater," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on November 16, 1914.  
  

The infant in the second photograph below (X02481A), labelled "untitled," looks quite similar to the baby in the "Mrs. Bezater" portrait. The younger appearance of the infant in "untitled" and the earlier date (July 25, 1914) does seem to match with the Bezater baby in the first portrait. More information is needed to determine if this is the same subject or not.  
  

Additional information about Mrs. Bezater will be added as it is researched.  
  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
