Richard Sandridge was the owner of the slaves [Jones](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/524 "----, JONES") (47068) and [Tom](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/525 "----, TOM") (47069), who he had hired out to the university in 1824 and 1825. Census information of 1820 shows Richard to have been a resident of Louisa County ([PL4790](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=4790 "Louisa County")). Although further information about Jones and Tom has not yet been found, advertisements from the Richmond Enquirer do reveal pertinent information about the slaves that were held by Sandridge at the time of his death (which, in turn, lead to other documents that provide yet more detail).
