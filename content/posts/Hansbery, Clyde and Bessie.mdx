"Clyde and Bessie Hansbery," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 23, 1915.

The Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 has an entry about a Clyde Hansberry (note the variation in spelling): "Hansberry Clyde h\[ome\] 415 5th St S W" (p. 97). A Joseph Hansberry also lives at the same residence. It is not yet known if this is the same person as photographed below; more information is needed.

Additional information about Clyde and Bessie Hansbery will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
