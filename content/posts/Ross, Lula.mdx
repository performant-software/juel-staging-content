Comments from Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019:

"Lula Ross was Charles Ross's mother." - Helen James, participant at Family Photo Day.

The UVA Library Catalogue states of this photo, "two standing women are also pictured in negative X07217A." Negative X07217A is labelled, "[Beatrice Harris](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1521 "Harris, Beatrice")".

Additional information about Lula Ross will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Ross, Lula](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1050358/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Ross, Lula")
