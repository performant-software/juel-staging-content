"Maude Carter," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 21 and November 15, 1918. 

Note the name is spelled Maude and Maud in the Holsinger ledgers.

Additional information about Maude Carter will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
