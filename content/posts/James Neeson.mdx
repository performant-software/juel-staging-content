<p>James Neeson, born in 1822, sat on the Board of Visitors from 1855-1864. He studied at Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA before studying law at Morgantown, WV, establishing a few law practices in the area. He eventually joined the House of Delegates and later, the state Senate in 1866. Primarily, he was known for his time as a Circuit Court Judge in Richmond, VA and also worked as the commonwealth&#39;s attorney. A native of Marion, VA, Neeson argued for western Virginia representation against the state constitution during the period of secession. He even stated at one point that the document &ldquo;degraded, debased, and vilified&rdquo; western Virginians. Neeson was known as a &ldquo;venomous Secessionist.&rdquo; He died in 1889.&nbsp;</p>
