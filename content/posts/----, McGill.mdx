McGill, male (last name unknown), is mentioned in a letter to Miss Mary L. Minor (perhaps Mary Lancelot Minor? or Mary I. Minor?) ([P48191](/en/people/abc02d52-7dd1-46c1-b9bc-06f856bf43f6 "P48191")) from McGill and Moses, transcribed by an S. D. M.

The letter is labelled as being to Mary L. Minor; it is unclear who the other recipients or "young ladies" are that are being addressed in the letter. The letter is from McGill and Moses, servants (or slaves), transcribed by S. D. M. (or S. L. M.?) (identity to be determined).

The letter states:

"Lone Cottage,

Mar. 31. 1863.

Dear “Young Ladies”: 

With a lively recollection of having been “sold” at about this time in years past, we – Mr. McGill and myself – tremblingly lifted the napkin from the fruit basket handed us by Charles.

The contents were beautiful to look at, and though the suspicion still lingers that “all is not gold that glitters,” I for one am bound to eat one of those cakes to-night. Should it turn out that you did not consult the Almanac before sending them, you will hear from us again – till then, please accept our warmest thanks.

Truly yours, S. D. M. for McGill & Moses"
