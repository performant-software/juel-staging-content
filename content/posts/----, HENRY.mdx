Henry, young male "boy" (last name unknown). Henry, along with [Cato](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/974 "----, CATO") ([P48004](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48004 "P48004")), appear to be contracted out by John Hartwell Cocke ([P43616](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43616 "P43616")), and were involved in early construction of the Academical Village. In a letter from A S Brockenbrough to Cocke, dated March 23, 1828, Brockenbrough discusses the construction of the Rotunda steps and cisterns and the involvement of Cato and Henry as laborers.
