"Standard Produce Company," three photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on February 14, 1917.

Standing before the company are (presumably) the owner(s) and employees and some passers-by. Standing in the center of the image, behind the children, are two African-American men; in all three photos one or both of them are blurred.

Records show the store first opened in 1910 (and is still in business today), and at the time of the photograph was located on West Main Street: The City Directory for 1914-15 lists it as, "Standard Produce Co, opp\[osite\] C & O (Main Street) Station" (p.229). The directory also lists a Morris Tyler as a driver for Standard Produce (although it is unclear whether he appears in the photographs below \[p.181\]).

These photographs are included in that, although not posed in-studio portraits of African Americans, they show actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play. They are highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment.

Additional information about the store and individuals photographed will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
