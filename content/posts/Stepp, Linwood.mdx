"Linwood Stepp," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 26, 1916.

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home database has an entry about a "John Early Steppe," born May 23, 1897. The entry states that he was born in Albemarle county to parents Linsey and Jamine Steppe, and that his brother was Linwood Steppe of Buffalo New York. More information is needed to determine if this information applies to the subject photographed below.

Additional information about Linwood Stepp will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Stepp, Linwood](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1044494/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Stepp, Linwood")
