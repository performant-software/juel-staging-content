Mary Watson, a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on November 16, 1918.

Mrs. Mary Watson has been positively identified by a family member to have been buried at the Daughters of Zion Cemetery. She is buried alongside her husband, Joseph Watson, who was a shoemaker (Burial List, 16 July 2019).

Additional information about Mary Watson will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Watson, Mary](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1050081/full/561,778/0/default.jpg "Watson, Mary")
