<p>"Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company Power Plant," eleven photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on February 17, 1913 and June 13, 1914.&nbsp;</p><p>There are five photographs from 1913 and six from 1914. The photographs show the interior/exterior of the plant; one photograph, below, shows what appears to be a wreckage with white and black men gathering (on the right) and a young black boy (on the left).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This photograph is included here in that, although not a posed studio portrait of African Americans, it does show actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play. It is highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment.</p><p>Relatedly, see "<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/2007" target="_blank" title="Employee Dinner Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company">Employee Dinner Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company</a>."</p><p>More details will be added as they are found.&nbsp;</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).&nbsp;</em><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1040972/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company Power Plant" title="Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company Power Plant " width="778" height="561" /><br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;<a href="https://v3.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1040972#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=3101%2C2842%2C2039%2C1512" target="_blank" title="Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company Power Plant">"Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company Power Plant,"</a>&nbsp;1913-02-17, photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X01120B29)</p><p></p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
