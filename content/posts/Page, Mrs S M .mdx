"Mrs. S. M. Page," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 21, 1918. 

The group portrait is categorized under "mourning custom" in the UVA Library Catalogue. 

Another portrait from the same date, below, is also labelled "Mrs. S. M. Page" (X06602A).  
  
The relation between the two photographs/sitters (whether they came to be photographed together or not) is not yet known.

Additional information about the subjects in the portrait will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
