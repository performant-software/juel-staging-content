"Beatrice Bynum," three photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on July 28, 1914.

  
Note the similar pose of the young girl (in the third photograph, below) to that of the young girl in the portrait labelled, "[Nettie Bynum](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1630 "Bynum, Mattie")."

The young woman in the first two photos below looks similar to another portrait by Holsinger, entitled "[Lena](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/993 "Lena")," from January 4, 1912.  
  
Additional information about Beatrice Bynum will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
