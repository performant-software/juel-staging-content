"Nellie Willis," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on January 26, 1911.

Additional information about Nellie Willis will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Willis, Nellie](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1038965/full/561,778/0/default.jpg "Willis, Nellie")
