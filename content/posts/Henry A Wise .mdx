<p>A member of the Virginia Board of Visitors from 1851-1855, Henry Alexander Wise (1806-1876) became known for his work in the Confederate Army as a political general and as governor of Virginia from 1856-1860. As governor, Wise pushed for the construction of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad to improve the state internally. Before becoming governor, Wise served in the US House of Representatives from 1833-1844 as a Jacksonian, a Whig, and then a Democrat before becoming the US minister to Brazil from 1844-1847. During wartime, Wise rose to the rank of Brigadier General and led defenses of both Richmond and Petersburg. He ended his career in private law practice and helped lead post-war negotiations about the boundary between Virginia and Maryland.</p>
