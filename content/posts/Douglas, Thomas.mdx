> "The local train over the Chesapeake & Ohio yesterday carried from Charlottesville and Albemarle County another contingent of thirty-nine men to Camp Leo, to take their places in the army that is to wrest the world from the grip of Prussianism. Colored men in all branches of the army are making splendid records in both fighting and general deportment and that the latest local quota will live up to the standard set up by the race is confidently believed. The men assembled at the local draft office at 11 o'clock, were checked up and given their final instructions. They marched to Main Street Station, where they were greeted by a large gathering of their relatives and friends and were provided with certain little comforts and an abundance of good cheer and best wishes. Those leaving were as follows: Carl Conrad, Charlottesville; Eddie Moore, Keswick; Genie W. Jefferson, Charlottesville; Harvey Morris Mitchell, Cobham; David V Young, Philadelphia; Willie R.
