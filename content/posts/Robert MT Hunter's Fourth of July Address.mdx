<p>On July 4<sup>th</sup>, 1839, Robert M.T. Hunter gave a speech celebrating American independence and various sources of democracy. &nbsp;At the time, Hunter was a U.S. Representative who would later became the Speaker of the House and a Senator.&nbsp; He also attended the University in 1826, and served on the Board of Visitors from 1845-1851.&nbsp; Hunter’s passionate speech is filled with complex references to historical events and important texts.&nbsp; Here are some of the highlights:</p><p>1. Hunter starts his speech by discussing the contributions of the Athenians, making several mentions in particular of Pericles, “who changed the entire spirit of their institutions.”&nbsp; Pericles was a major proponent of Athenian democracy, and led the Delian League.&nbsp; The Delian League was originally based in Delos, where Pericles “seized the common treasure.”&nbsp; In the midst of discussing the democratic and cultural achievements of the Athenians, Hunter quotes “Elegy Written in a Country Courtyard,” published by Thomas Gray in 1751:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hands that the rod of empire might have swayed,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Then waked to ecstasy the living lyre,”</p><p>2. Continuing with the theme of Athenian greatness, Hunter references a painting of Alexander the Great by Apelles of Kos.&nbsp; He uses this reference to emphasize the lasting impact Athens and Greek civilization had on the world.&nbsp; Though the “colors of Apelles have faded… the radiant forms of Athenian genius must endure.”</p><p>3. Jumping ahead in history to the founding of the New World, Hunter discusses the rise of republican institutions.&nbsp; He mentions two groups of people who fled persecution in the Old World, the Cavaliers and the Round Heads, who brought with them, “a love of adventure and a spirit of independence.”&nbsp; Roundheads were supporters of a constitutional monarchy and Parliament during the English Civil War in the 17<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; Many Roundheads were Puritans, who later settled in New England where, “the republican spirit [was] self-educated in the wilderness, [and] reached a high degree of cultivation.”&nbsp; Cavaliers were the opponents of Roundheads, and supported the King and an absolute monarchy.&nbsp; Ironically, it was this un-republican group that became the mascot of Virginia.&nbsp; Fun fact:&nbsp; The American football club at Oxford University is also called the Cavaliers.</p><p>4. Hunter honors the spirit of the Founding fathers of the American Revolution by quoting Thomas Moore’s oriental romance, “Lalla Rookh.” &nbsp;The poem is about the daughter of an emperor engaged to a king of the Persian state Bukhara.&nbsp; While journeying to meet him, a poet regales her, and the work is comprised mainly of stories told by him to Lalla.&nbsp; The quote used by Hunter is from “The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan,”</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That high and lofty name,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The light, the landmark on the cliffs of fame,"</p><p>Spoken by the hero Azim, this quote muses if the way to free a man from the “sloth” of&nbsp; life is by teaching him virtue that will allow his name to be famous after his death.</p><p>5. UVa has always had a complex history with slavery, a fact put on display in Hunter’s speech, when he uses a quote from Horace to defend the institution of slavery.&nbsp; Hunter argues that slavery allows black people to live in a country where they “subsist with most comfort and [are] best fitted for occupation.”&nbsp; To argue with this sentiment, Hunter purports, would be as useful as trying to reason with the “caput insanabile tribus Anticyris” – in other words, an incurably insane person.&nbsp; This quote comes from an Ode of the famous Roman poet Horace, and literally translates to “a person incurable by three Anticyrae.”&nbsp; The Anticyrae were islands off the coast of Greece known for bountiful amounts of the plant hellebore, which was once used as a treatment for madness – so a person incurable by three Anticyrae would be truly insane.</p><p style="padding-left: 60px;">“Let one spirit of the first born Cain<br /> Reign in all bosoms, that each heart being set<br /> On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,<br /> And darkness be the burier of the dead."&nbsp;</p><p>This quote, from “Part 2 of Henry IV,” by William Shakespeare, is Hunter’s way of discouraging acts of violence to end slavery and disturb the societal organizations of the South.</p><p>6. At one point, Hunter turns to the reputation of Virginia, claiming it was not as prestigious a commonwealth as it once was.&nbsp; He urges the “sons” of Virginia to rally around their home state and restore it to its former political glory.&nbsp; He compares the case of Virginia to that of Randolph at Bannockburn, stating, “that the rose had fallen from her chaplet.”&nbsp; This is in reference to the Battle of Bannockburn, a victory in the First War for Scottish Independence in 1314.&nbsp; Thomas Randolph was a commander of Scottish troops; at one point in the battle, Randolph miscalculated and let English troops pass by where his army was supposed to be holding them back.&nbsp; Legend has it that Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, exclaimed to Randolph, “A rose has fallen from your chaplet, Randolph!”&nbsp; Another commander offered to assist Randolph, but Bruce insisted Randolph fix his mistake for himself, as Virginia needed to fix its mistakes and regain respect in the United States.</p><p>7. Hunter gives particular praise to the editor of the Farmers Register, Edmund Ruffin, whom he says “has rendered [Virginia] more service than most, or perhaps, all of its politicians in the last twenty years,”.&nbsp; He compares Ruffin to “a Sinclair or a Coke,” referring to Sir John Sinclair and Thomas Coke.&nbsp; Sinclair was a Scottish politician who was also known for his contributions to the science of agriculture, and was a major proponent for trying new methods of agriculture.&nbsp; Coke was a politician from Wales known for playing a significant role in sparking the British Agricultural Revolution.&nbsp; Ironically, the acclaimed Ruffin shut down the Farmers Register only three years after this speech was given.</p><p>8. Returning to his discussion of Virginia’s lost glory, Hunter says that if “the leaves of Virginia's glory, like the holly of Avenel, ‘have been blighted by a half hour's frost,’ he should bear them, in the spirit of the Graeme, ‘so near the sky as to make amends for their stinted growth.’”&nbsp; This is a reference to the novel “The Abbot,” by famous Scottish author Walter Scott, published in 1830.&nbsp; Avenel refers to the castle in which the story takes place, and Graeme is the protagonist of the novel.&nbsp; Graeme serves as page for Lady Avenel, and is initially disliked by servants and others in the castle.&nbsp; He eventually “makes amends for [his] stinted growth,” and becomes the Avenel heir.</p>
