"Carrie Magruder," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 18, 1914.  
  
An unlabelled portrait was also taken on the same date and has the similar photo ID of X02456A2. Perhaps the young boy and woman had come together to the studio to have their portraits taken; more information is needed, however, before this can be stated with certainty. 

Additional information about Carrie Magruder will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Magruder, Carrie](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042305/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Magruder, Carrie")
