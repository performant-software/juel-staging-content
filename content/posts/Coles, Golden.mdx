Golden Coles, a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on June 12, 1916.

From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019:  
"I am 82 years old + searching through photos of an exhibit I ran across Mr. Golden Coles, who I think is related to my father Hasting L. Coles." - Clariece Coles Harris, participant at Family Photo Day. 

For information about Hastings (b. 1884) and Pauline (b. 1895) Coles and their children (Robert, Carrie, Kenneth, Hastings Jr., Richard, Earl, Catherine, Laura, Pauline, Constance, Clariece, Ryland), of Stony Point Road, see the newspaper article linked [here](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/2068 "Coles Family") (citation below).

Golden Coles was the son of Addie Golden Coles and William Coles, who lived in the Gospel Hill neighborhood (where the University of Virginia hospital is now located). Addie, William, and several members of the family are buried at the Daughters of Zion Cemetery. In the 1920's, Charles E. Coles and his sons owned the largest black-owned construction company in Charlottesville (source: [Politically Active African Americans in Charlottesville](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/politics/profiles.html "Politically Active African American Individuals in Charlottesville")).

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home [database entry](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/search_funeral.cgi?start_page=0&last=Coles) for Addie Golden Coles indicates: "born March 2, 1869; parents John & Jeannette Golden; died October 4, 1944; buried at Society Cemetery." (Note: "Society Cemetery" is referring to the Daughters of Zion Cemetery.)

Additional information about Golden Coles will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
