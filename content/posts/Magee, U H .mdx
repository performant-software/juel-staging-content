"U. H. Magee," two photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on June 23, 1914.

Of interest in the photographs is the unidentified African American woman (likely the nurse/nanny) crouched to the right of the frame, supporting the child. This portion of the negative would have been cropped out in the final printed product.  
  
Although in this particular instance the portraits are of just the infant, photos of infants and their nurses are still common in this time period, and Holsinger took several (see for instance, [Mrs. Hugh Davis](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1556 "Davis, Mrs. Hugh"), [Mrs. W. B. Forsythe](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1655 "Forsythe, Mrs. W. B."), [Mr. Trotter](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1325 "Mr. Trotter"), [J. E. Shepherd](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1922 "J. E. Shepherd"), [Margaret Lewis/Mrs. Shepherd](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1323 "Margaret Lewis / Mrs. Shepherd")). 

Additional information about U. H. Magee, and the identity of the woman photographed, will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
