William and Charles operated a barber shop at 1407 University Avenue, which was started by their father, William L. Brown, in 1865. Charles never married.</p><p>William L. Brown (1843-1896) was married to Harriet Brown (1850-1902). W.

He later moved to 213 Anderson Street;&nbsp;the Charlottesville City Directory 1914-15 lists William Franklin Brown's home address as 213 Anderson.&nbsp;He then lived on Whiteâ€™s Avenue (8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;St. NW.) before moving to 709 Page Street, where he was living at the time of his death in 1952 (his father-in-law, Hudson Jenkins, owned several lots in the 8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and Page vicinity). William was buried at Oakwood Cemetery.</p><p>Charles lived in the family home at 306 Ridge Street until his illness and death in 1937.&nbsp;<br /><br />Notes about Charlottesville appeared in African-American newspapers from Richmond, Washington, D.C., and other area newspapers, mentioning social visits, events, occasions, and so on. The notice below is from the September 22, 1900&nbsp;<em>The Colored American</em>, a Washington, D.C. newspaper, mentions Charles (p.4):<br /><img src="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/media/images/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-02%20at%2010.49.15%20AM.png" alt="The Colored American, September 22, 1900, p.4.2" title="The Colored American, September 22, 1900, p.4.2" width="316" height="569" /><br /><br />Other notices from 1937 (courtesy Edwina St. Rose):<br /><img src="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/media/images/BrownCHarticles.jpg" title="Charles H. Brown Obituary" width="436" height="581" /></p><p>The notices read: 1. "COLORED BARBER DIES [1937]. Charles H. Brown, sixty-two years old colored resident [o]f this city, died in a local hospital this morning at 4 o' clock from chronic nephritis. Charles was well-known to the University of Virginia students and many alumni, having been a barber in the University section for the past thirty-five years. His death followed an illness of about a month, during which time he was confined to the hospital"; 2. "Charley Brown, Barber. Editor&nbsp;<em>The Daily Progress</em>&nbsp;In this relentless realm of rude realities that we call the world it is a rare thing to find any one who is a perfect fit in the specific niches which the necessities of nature chanced to carve for him. A rare and real fitness, however, was seen by all in the case of Charley Brown the colored barber, who died here last week. He was for forty years my faithful friend. In 1875 Charley's father removed from my face that combination of dust, down and dermis, that marked manhoods first shave, and he himself began shaving me in 1889 and so continued to the day of his death. I have seen him shave the sound, the sick, and even [ci devants], and he always made it more of a ministration than a menial service. He, more than any other that I have ever known, knew the inside 'news' of this University for the past fifty years. 'Next,' next to next, and the man in his chair, conversed more confidently before him than before many of their own friends. He was a sphinx but a sphinx &nbsp;in whom a sense of humour sometimes showed. Even when questioned he tempered the tales that must be told. Self-respecting, respectful and in turn respected, he ministered to thousands who have gone their way, from Maine to Texas, carrying as few mournful memories, of this too often excruciating ordeal, as human effort could prevent. He won their regard and finally friendship. I know that thousands will be saddened to know of his death. Old Mother Earth makes many loans, of the elements of life, but for all, in due time, the day of recall comes. Was the loan worth while, is all she asks--trial and error. Did he from his niche do that which was best for the betterment of mankind? To my mind, Charley Brown, the colored barber, lived a life well worth remembering. P. B. Barringer."</p><p></p><p><strong>SOURCES</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/sources/images/items/uva-lib:1048858" target="_blank" title="Familiar Faces The Corner, Charlottesville">Familiar Faces The Corner, Charlottesville</a>," 1917-11-12 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X05712B)<br /><br /></span>- printed notes, flipbook vol. 7.2&nbsp;<br /><br />- Daughters of Zion Cemetery Burial List, 24 November 2021 (courtesy The&nbsp;Preservers of the Daughters of Zion Cemetery)</p><p>- comments from Family Photo Day courtesy of Ms. Edwina St. Rose (great-granddaughter of William F.
