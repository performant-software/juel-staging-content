"Fred Johnson," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 14, 1914. They appear to be of two different men. 

A Fred Johnson is listed in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home database; it is unknown if the individual listed is the same person as the men photographed below: "Frederick Kendell Johnson, born September 23 1898 in Ohio; father Albert Johnson; spouse Harriet Johnson; died November 29, 1962 in Charlottesville Virginia at his home of 359 10 1/2 Street; buried in Lincoln Cemetery." More information is needed to determine if the database entry is of the person(s) photographed.

Additional information about Fred Johnson will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
