"Nettie Bynum," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 4, 1914. Note: previously, the UVA Library Catalogue had the entry mislabelled as, "Nattie Bynum."

  
Note the similar pose of the young girl below to that of the young girl in the portrait labelled, "[Beatrice Bynum](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1628 "Bynum, Beatrice")." 

Additional information about Nettie Bynum will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
