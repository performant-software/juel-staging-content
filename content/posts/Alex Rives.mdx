<p>Rives (1806-1885) served the Board of Visitors from 1865-1866, an alumnus of the Virginia Law school. In addition to this, he became a federal judge in western Virginia in 1871 after appointment by President Grant, and sat on the House of Delegates and the state Senate from 1852-1867. Rives was a well-known Republican and attempted a run for the US House of Representatives in 1844 with the Whig party.
