W. Holsinger).&nbsp;</em>In this instance, the label "Mrs. Ernest Allen" refers to the mother of the baby pictured.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1044181/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg" alt="Green, Viola" title="Green, Viola" width="1000" height="1337" />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p>- <a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1044181#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=-1559%2C-160%2C6039%2C4477" title="Miss Viola Green">Viola Green</a>, 1916-06-01 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X04183A)</p><p>-&nbsp;<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x000196692" target="_blank" title="Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15">Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 [Hathi Trust]</a></p><p>- <a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/last_names.html">J.
