Miss Viola Green, a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on June 1, 1916.

Viola Green was likely photographed in the occasion of graduation from the Jefferson Graded School. She was married to [Horace Porter](/en/people/63036cdc-b13c-4af2-9c6b-ff9a8ba7835a "Porter, Horace") ([P48016](/en/people/63036cdc-b13c-4af2-9c6b-ff9a8ba7835a "P48016")), a longtime employee at the Holsinger Studio. 

J. F. Bell Funeral Home Records indicate Viola was born May 20, 1898 in Albemarle County to parents Charles Green and Jane Tyler. She died November 18, 1985 at 812 Rose Hill Drive in Charlottesville (presumably her place of residence at the time). Her and Horace had a son, Robert Porter, born June 3, 1927. Robert died October 13, 1982, and is buried at Oakwood Cemetery.

The African-American Cemeteries in Albemarle and Amherst Counties states that Horace H. Porter was buried in Lincoln Cemetery (1893-1985), as was his wife Viola (1898-1985). 

The African-American Cemeteries in Albemarle and Amherst Counties states that [Viola Green Porter](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/db/person/details/LNC:122/ "Porter, Viola Green") was buried in [Lincoln Cemetery](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/db/cemetery/details/LNC/ "Lincoln Cemetery") (1893-1985), as was her husband [Horace H. Porter](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1155# "Porter, Horace H. "). 

Additional information about Viola Green will be added as it is researched.  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._ In this instance, the label "Mrs. Ernest Allen" refers to the mother of the baby pictured.
