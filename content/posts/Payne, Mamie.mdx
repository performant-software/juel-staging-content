"Mamie Payne," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 25, 1917.

The identity of the subjects is unknown, but the subjects in this portrait are also the same man and woman in the portrait labelled, "[Tom Moore](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1665 "Moore, Tom")," and the photo itself is a duplicate. 

Additional information about Mamie Payne will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._ ![Payne, Mamie](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1048732/full/461,678/0/default.jpg "Payne, Mamie")
