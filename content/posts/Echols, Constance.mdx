"Constance Echols," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken by on December 17, 1912.

The portrait of a young boy named Robert Echols was also taken on the same date; whether the subjects are related in any way, or, whether the subjects were brought in by the same person(s) to be photographed is not known. 

Additionally, a third portrait, "Master Marion Echols," was labelled in a consecutive order with those of Constance and Robert Echols, although it is dated December 16, 1912. 

Additional information about Constance Echols will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
