"Julia Barrett," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on February 27, 1914.

  
The Charlottesville 1910 Census has an entry about a Julia Barrett; it may or may not be about the individuals photographed below: ¨Barrett, Julia, age 30, female, black, birth place Virginia; single; can read and write; servant - chambermaid; dwelling/workplace 165 Main Street Charlottesville.¨ The apparant age of the woman in the portrait below right could be about 34; more research is needed, however, to determine if the census entry and the portrait are of the same woman. 

A Julia Barrett is also mentioned in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database; it may or may not refer to the individuals photographed below: ¨Barrett, Julia, born March 2 1875 in Nelson County Virginia; mother Lindsay Bolling; died March 31, 1941 in Charlottesville Virginia; buried in Faber Virginia. While this entry does not have a listed age that matches the census information, it is not uncommon for there to have been age/spelling discrepancies (and/or transcription errors). More information is needed, however, to determine if either entry is about the older woman photographed below.

Additional information about Julia Barrett will be added as it is researched.  
  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
