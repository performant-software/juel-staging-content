Holsinger taken on November 25, 1916.</p><p>Other photographs that captured a lit cigar/cigarette are&nbsp;<a href="https://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1300" title="Bill Hurley">Bill Hurley</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1740" target="_blank" title="Will Mobley">Will Mobley</a>.</p><p>Note that this portrait shows the two young men dressed in worker's clothing. It was not uncommon in this time period to choose to depict oneself in one's work clothing and with accessories/tools of the trade when sitting for a photo, known as "occupational portraits" (Finefield) (for an example, see&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1206" target="_blank" title="Lightfoot, James">James Lightfoot</a>).&nbsp;This portrait, however, gives no indication of the work of the individuals below, and so technically is not an occupational portrait, per se: they are dressed in generic laborer's clothing that do not specifically indicate their profession.&nbsp;Perhaps, then, they simply came in to have their portrait taken in the clothing they were wearing at that time.&nbsp;Whether purposefully showcasing their occupation or not (choosing to be photographed "as is"), these are interesting acts of self-representation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Additional information about Tommie Mills will be added as it is researched.</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</em><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1044806/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg" alt="Mills, Tommie" title="Mills, Tommie" width="1000" height="1337" />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1044806#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=-1550%2C-108%2C5922%2C4391" target="_blank" title="Mills, Tommie">Tommie Mills</a>," 1916-11-25 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X04614A)&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
