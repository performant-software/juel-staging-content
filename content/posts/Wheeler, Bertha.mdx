"Bertha Wheeler," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on January 2, 1917.

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home database lists two Bertha Wheelers; they may or may not be related to the subjects shown in the photograph below: "Bertha Wheeler, birth date unknown, died at age 80 on January 22, 1952 in Petersburg Virginia and buried in Charlottesville, Virginia." The second entry lists, "Bertha B. Wheeler, born January 1871 in Charlottesville Virginia to parents David and Fannie (Brown) Winn; spouse James Wheeler; died January 24, 1952 in Charlottesville Virginia and buried at Union Ridge Cemetery at age 80." 

Additional information about Bertha Wheeler will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Wheeler, Bertha](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1044956/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Wheeler, Bertha") **Sources**
