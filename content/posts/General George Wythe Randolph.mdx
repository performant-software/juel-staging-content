<p>General G.W. Randolph (1818-1867) was much more well-known for his time as a Virginia leader than for his time on the Board of Visitors from 1864-1865. Educated at the University of Virginia and the Naval Academy, he was admitted to the bar in 1840. Randolph became a major in the VA militia and eventually a Confederate general. He was appointed as the Confederate Secretary of War in 1862 by Jefferson Davis. As a major, he led the &ldquo;Richmond Howitzers&rdquo; in the Battle of Big Bethel and Hampton in 1861. As Secretary of War, he attempted to retake key southern cities from the Union such as New Orleans, but plans did come to fruition and his frustration and health caused him to resign later in the year. After his time in the war, Randolph became an advocate for workers and developed some socialist viewpoints. He died in Albemarle, his hometown, and was buried at Monticello in 1867.</p>
