"S. Arundall," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on June 10, 1918. 

Note the spelling variation of the last name (Arundall, Arrundall) - both variations were used in the business ledgers (by which the photos were labelled). Note also the photos are duplicates of one another. 

  
Additional information about S. Arundall / Arrundall will be added as it is researched.  
  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
