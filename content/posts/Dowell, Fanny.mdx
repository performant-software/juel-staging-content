"Fanny Dowell," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 19, 1918.

Note that two very similar-looking women appear in the portraits labelled "[Hattie Williams](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1936 "Williams, Hattie")" and "[Maude Williams](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1939 "Williams, Maude")," also taken on the same date. The women hold the same small purse and wear the same hat in both portraits, and also have a similar outfit on. Perhaps they are related (by birth or marriage); more information is needed, however, to determine their relationship. The portraits of the three women are labelled consecutively as well: Maude Williams (X06858A), Hattie Williams (X06859A), and Fanny Dowell (X06860A). They may have went to the studio together, for instance.

Additional information about Fanny Dowell will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Dowell, Fanny](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049901/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Dowell, Fanny")
