Berkley (last name unknown), adult male. What little is known about Berkley thus far is from an 1865 letter, that identifies him as the slave of Dr. Maupin ([P43731](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43731 "Maupin, Dr. Socrates")).

  
The letter, "\[?\] To Aunt \[?\] March 8, 1865" details the Union Army’s occupation of Charlottesville, written by one of John B. Minor's ([P22874](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=22874 "P22874")) daughters (which one is to be determined) to an Aunt (which one also to be determined):

> Dr. Maupin lost one of his horses, & Berkley was discovered in the act of riding off the other – He of course went, taking his family along – Two other men of the Doctor's went also - A Brigade was encamped on Carr’s Hill ([PL8512](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8512 "PL8512")) & another near Mr. Preston's ([P43698](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43698 "Dr. Preston")).

The letter also mentions servants Rachel, [Humphrey](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1972# "----, HUMPHREY") ([P49029](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=49029 "P49029")), and Henry. 

More information about Berkley will be added as it is discovered.
