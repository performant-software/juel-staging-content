Berkley (last name unknown), adult male. What little is known about Berkley thus far is from an 1865 letter, that identifies him as the slave of Dr. Maupin ([P43731](/en/people/fc75bf66-fd65-4729-b33f-61e4e01c1b7e "Maupin, Dr. Socrates")).

  
The letter, "\[?\] To Aunt \[?\] March 8, 1865" details the Union Army’s occupation of Charlottesville, written by one of John B. Minor's ([P22874](/en/people/f624eefa-050a-46a9-a735-298a6fe3ce23 "P22874")) daughters (which one is to be determined) to an Aunt (which one also to be determined):

> Dr. Maupin lost one of his horses, & Berkley was discovered in the act of riding off the other – He of course went, taking his family along – Two other men of the Doctor's went also - A Brigade was encamped on Carr’s Hill ([PL8512](/en/places/7daaca94-65b7-4a9e-8b12-fb16d8e99fc1 "PL8512")) & another near Mr. Preston's ([P43698](/en/people/36b89684-f4fa-45bc-b1b6-08e89dcaee44 "Dr. Preston")).

The letter also mentions servants Rachel, [Humphrey](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1972# "----, HUMPHREY") ([P49029](/en/people/8637385a-77c0-4b70-81a7-2ff7fcdf5132 "P49029")), and Henry. 

More information about Berkley will be added as it is discovered.
