"Orbrey Stark," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 27, 1918.

An Obrey Starks (note the variation in spelling of both the first and last names) is listed in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database; this may or may not be the same individual as photographed below: ¨Starks, Obrey, born March 8, 1892 in Advance Mills to George and Lucy (Johnson) Starks; died October 20, 1964 at 1104 Rosser Avenue, Charlottesville, Virginia and buried at Lincoln Cemetery.¨ More information is needed to verify if this entry refers to the same person in the portrait.

Additional information about Orbrey Stark will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Stark, Orbrey](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049624/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Stark, Orbrey")
