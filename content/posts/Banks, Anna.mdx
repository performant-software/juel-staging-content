"Anna Banks," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on May 19, 1917.

This is one of several portraits by Holsinger that show a nanny/nurse with an infant/children. Of these, only a few portraits show the woman in a nurse/domestic costume. 

  
Additional information about Anna Banks will be added as it is researched.  
  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._ In this case, possibly the name "Anna Banks" may either be the woman in the portrait, or, her employer (as she is dressed in a nurse's costume with the infant).
