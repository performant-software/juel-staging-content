<p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">John Hartwell Cocke (1780-1866) served on the Virginia Board of Visitors from 1825-1851. Cocke was a Brigadier General in the Fluvanna militia, elevating him to consideration to become governor. Cocke expressed “continual hostility to slavery” and criticized the tobacco-centered economy of the South. Cocke had some communication with Thomas Jefferson beginning in 1808 and also served on the Board for Joseph C. Cabell’s James River and Kanawha Co. As a voice of disgust with the alcohol culture in Virginia, he led as President of the Virginia Temperance Society in 1834 which eventually beame the American Temperance Union. General Cocke also established the Albemarle Agricultural Society in 1817, which he organized with Jefferson’s ideas. Cocke’s desire for public service and passion for education led him to be a cornerstone figure in starting up the University with roles concerning budgeting and land purchases. His papers further detail his correspondences with major Virginia figures like Jefferson and Madison.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
