Holsinger taken on August 31, 1916, December 28, 1916, and December 27, 1918.</p><p>The first of the three images below is an example of a common practice in early photography whereby the mother, covered in draping, would support or prop up the baby so that a picture can be taken of the baby alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that an <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/2033" target="_blank" title="Untitled">unlabelled portrait</a> from the same date also shows an infant (ID X07230A). Perhaps the children were from the same family and were photographed at the same time; additional information is needed, however, to determine if the two subjects are related.&nbsp;</p><p>From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019:&nbsp;</p><p>"Stuart Fuller was a waiter at Queen Charlotte Hotel. We worked together at the Noris House on 29 South, where he was a waiter and I was a dishwasher. He was a wonderful person." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.&nbsp;</p><p>Additional information about Stuart Fuller will be added as it is researched.</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</em></p><p>Below: X04392A (August 31, 1916)<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1044512/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Fuller, Stuart" title="Fuller, Stuart" width="778" height="561" />&nbsp;</p><p>Below: X04720A (December 28, 1916)<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1044942/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Fuller, Stuart" title="Fuller, Stuart" width="778" height="561" /></p><p>Below: X07229A (December 27, 1918)<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1050373/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Fuller, Stuart" title="Fuller, Stuart" width="778" height="561" /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1044512#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=0%2C-60%2C3953%2C2931" title="X04392A">Stuart Fuller</a>," 1916-08-31 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X04392A)<br /><br />- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1044942#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=0%2C-71%2C4004%2C2969" title="Fuller, Stuart">Stuart Fuller</a>," 1916-12-28 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X04720A)</span></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1050373#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=-1%2C-63%2C3948%2C2926" target="_blank" title="Stuart Fuller">Stuart Fuller</a>," 1918-12-27 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X07229A)</span></p><p>- printed notes, flipbook vol.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>- comments from Family Photo Day courtesy Mr. Melvin Flannagan, Jr.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
