Dr. John Rodes Woods sat on the Board of Visitors from 1865-1872. Born in Albemarle County at “Holkham” in 1815, he became a prominent agricultural figure in the region, particularly at the University. He attended a small preparatory school at the University of Virginia and went on to graduate with a degree in medicine from Virginia in 1836. He ran a large estate in Virginia of a few thousand acres, particularly raising sheep, cattle, and horses from England. He sat on the Board of Directors for the Virginia Central Railroad in place of William J. Robertson from 1857 to 1869. He died at his Holkham estate in 1885.
