<p>Commodore Lewis, male (last name unknown). There are several times throughout the Board of Visitors Minutes that "Slave Commodore Lewis" is mentioned. He was originally purchased by the then-Proctor John A. Carr (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43651" target="_blank" title="P43651">P43651</a>), Professor Davis (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=33195" title="P33195">P33195</a>), and Dr. Patterson (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43634" title="P43634">P43634</a>) "for the use of the university"; subsequently the university paid the sum of "$580" to the three men, for Lewis "to be held hereafter as the property of the University" (July 10, 1832).</p>
