Commodore Lewis, male (last name unknown). There are several times throughout the Board of Visitors Minutes that "Slave Commodore Lewis" is mentioned. He was originally purchased by the then-Proctor John A. Carr ([P43651](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43651 "P43651")), Professor Davis ([P33195](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=33195 "P33195")), and Dr. Patterson ([P43634](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43634 "P43634")) "for the use of the university"; subsequently the university paid the sum of "$580" to the three men, for Lewis "to be held hereafter as the property of the University" (July 10, 1832).
