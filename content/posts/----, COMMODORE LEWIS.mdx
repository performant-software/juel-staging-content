Commodore Lewis, male (last name unknown). There are several times throughout the Board of Visitors Minutes that "Slave Commodore Lewis" is mentioned. He was originally purchased by the then-Proctor John A. Carr ([P43651](/en/people/5b11f1a1-c406-463c-a986-20a46aae1b70 "P43651")), Professor Davis ([P33195](/en/people/57445ae1-f950-4643-9687-6b21284fe405 "P33195")), and Dr. Patterson ([P43634](/en/people/395e932c-8b6d-4b49-80a2-8adebaaf6c77 "P43634")) "for the use of the university"; subsequently the university paid the sum of "$580" to the three men, for Lewis "to be held hereafter as the property of the University" (July 10, 1832).
