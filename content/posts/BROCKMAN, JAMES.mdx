James Brockman is mentioned several times in the Proctor's Daybook, in entries that describe his role as overseer. An entry dated February 24, 1823 was for $6.50, for "Labour acct. draft to A. J. Brockenbrough ([P43627](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43627 "P43627")) for this sum paid to James Brockman for his expenses to Louisa ([PL4338](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=4338 "PL4338")) \[town in Virginia, for\] hiring laborers." A February 21, 1824 entry for $120.00 states, "Labour acct. draft to Overseer acct. for Js. Brockman services 1823." The remaining entries indicate his role in overseeing services related to slaves:
