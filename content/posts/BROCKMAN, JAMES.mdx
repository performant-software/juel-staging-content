James Brockman is mentioned several times in the Proctor's Daybook, in entries that describe his role as overseer. An entry dated February 24, 1823 was for $6.50, for "Labour acct. draft to A. J. Brockenbrough ([P43627](/en/people/3cf66e55-3c68-473d-b75d-566f5acb7b79 "P43627")) for this sum paid to James Brockman for his expenses to Louisa ([PL4338](/en/places/800349f6-c4e2-4a6f-aafd-f7eddb04c366 "PL4338")) \[town in Virginia, for\] hiring laborers." A February 21, 1824 entry for $120.00 states, "Labour acct. draft to Overseer acct. for Js. Brockman services 1823." The remaining entries indicate his role in overseeing services related to slaves:
