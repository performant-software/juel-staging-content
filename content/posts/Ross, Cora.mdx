Comments from Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019, by Ms. Katherine Thompson Jackson:

"I believe this is my great-grandfather (John Thompson's) sister, Cora Thompson, born in 1883 to John Thompson (15) and Alice Cora Douglas Thompson (18). In this picture 28 years old. In 1910, she was married to James Lemuel Ross, and they have 5 children. Her occupation was House Cleaner. Cora & James Lemuel lived in Charlottesville. My name is Katherine Thompson Jackson."

Comments from Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019, by Ms. Helen James:

"Lived in Fluvanna. My great-grandmother's name was Cora Ross. My grandmother was Marie Ross. My mother's Florince Cora Ross - my name is Helen Ross. My son's name is Corie Ross."

Additional information about Cora Ross will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
