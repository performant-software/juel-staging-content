"Lila Lewis," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on September 23, 1916.

A Lila Lewis is listed in the Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15: "Lewis Lila cook h\[ome\] 126 9th S W" (p. 124).

Additionally, the 1910 Census has the following entry about a Lila Lewis: "Lila, 12, mulatto, birth place Virginia, can read and write, attended school the prior year, house number 126, family number 178, living on 7 1/2 street Charlottesville." This may or may not be about the same individual photographed below, although the estimated age of the subject in the photo does appear to match the 1910 census entry (approximately 18).  
  
Additional information about Lila Lewis will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Lewis, Lila](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1044572/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Lewis, Lila")
