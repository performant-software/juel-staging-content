Grandma Kidda, female (last name unknown), adult. Although not directly employed by the University of Virginia, Grandma Kidda indirectly relates to the University in being a family slave of a student, in this case, Charles Rufus Ayres, who attended the university in sessions 24-5 (1847-9). Many of the university students came from families that had slaves; their interaction with the slaves on campus was surely informed by these prior interactions. For more information about Ayres, please see Jean L. Cooper's [Students of the University of Virginia, 1825-1874](https://uvastudents.wordpress.com/2013/09/07/charles-rufus-ayres-23-dec-1826-11-nov-1859/ "Jean L. Cooper, Students of the University of Virginia, 1825-1874").
