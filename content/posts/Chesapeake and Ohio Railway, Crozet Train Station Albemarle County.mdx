"Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, Crozet Train Station Albemarle County," nine photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on December 5, 1913. 

The photographs show the station from different angles, with three of them showing black and white passengers/passersby and rail laborers.

The first photograph below (X01920B4) shows eight black and white men; one laborer is African American. Two men are in the far background and are blurry such that their identification is unknown. 

The second photograph (X01920B8) shows eight people total, four of whom are African-American laborers (on the railroad tracks to the right).

The third photograph (X01920B10) shows four people total. Three are African-American laborers on the tracks; one person (right midground) is blurred.

These photograph are included here in that, although not posed studio portraits of African Americans, they show actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play. They are highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment.  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
