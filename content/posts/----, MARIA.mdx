Maria, female, is mentioned once in the Proctor's Daybook. An April 4, 1822 entry records "Continued expenses to J. M. Perry ([P47043](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47043 "P47043")) for the hire of Maria" at 25.00$. Perry also hired out a boy named [Guy](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/457 "Guy") in the same time period.
