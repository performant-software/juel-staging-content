"Lucy Burns," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger on October 14, 1918.

  
The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database has the following entry, which may or may not be about the woman photographed below: "Burns, Lucy Lee, born March 15, 1886 in Albemarle County Virginia to parents Vander Burk and Estella (Jones) Burk, spouse John W. Burns; died January 1 1981 in Towers Hospital Charlottesville, Virginia and buried in Lincoln Cemetery; son John W. Burns, daughters Sadie Graham and Dorothy Jones." The dates for this entrant do match with the apparent age of the woman photographed below, but more information is needed to confirm this information.

The tombstone of [Lucy L. Burns](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/db/person/details/LNC:102/ "Lucy L. Burns") is at [Lincoln Cemetery](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/db/cemetery/details/LNC/ "Lincoln Cemetery") (owned by J. F. Bell Funeral Home). 

  
Additional information about Lucy Burns will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
