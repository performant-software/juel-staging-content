William Preston, adult male. Known as "Uncle Billy," Preston was described as a "colored" man and "a skilled mechanic" who worked for a brief period as a janitor (see Patton's article below for description).  

Possibly, the same William Preston who died April 17, 1895, as detailed in the [_Daily Progress (_April 17, 1895)](http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:2071610/view?fbclid=IwAR1zkelGoa9tni5s1j-WR_HsP1VWd-qf0b0HQ31Fdi6gMaPZZBje8UnoD9o#openLayer/uva-lib:2071611/2402/990/3/1/1 "William Preston article"): "William Preston, a well known colored man, died at the University this morning, aged sixty-seven years. He was a bricklayer, and since the war has been engaged at the University. He was a slave of Captain Parrow. His wife died last week at the age of seventy-eight." (1880 Census: Mrs. Flora Preston, Washerwoman, William Brickmason, mother-in-law Rebecca King). 

Mrs. Flora Preston, his wife, was reported about the previous week: "Mrs. Flora Preston, died at her residence near the University of Virginia on Tuesday 9th inst. Mrs. Preston was about 77 years of age and was one of the oldest and most consistent members of the Mt. Zion Baptist Church. She was laid to rest in a handsome black cloth covered casket, handsomely trimmed. The pall-bearers were Messrs. John Dickerson, Adam Ellis, Robt. Gilliam, James Brown, Charles James and William Chapman. A. C. Mabrey funeral director." (source: _Richmond Planet_ April 20, 1895)

It is not yet known whether William Preston is the ascendent of [Albert Preston](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1492 "Preston, ALbert").
