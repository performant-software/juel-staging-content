"Ada Desper," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on July 20, 1914.

  
The J. F. Bell Funeral Home database has information on an Ada Desper; it may or may not be about the same individual (yet to be determined): Ada Florence Desper; born June 15, 1880 to parents Richard and Mary Susan Randolph; died October 25, 1957; buried at Mount Calvery Cemetery in Ivy, Virginia.

Additional information about Ada Desper will be added as it is researched.

NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
