"Elsworth Washington," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on February 26, 1917.

The Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 has an entry about an Ellsworth Washington (note the alternate spelling of the first name); it may or may not be the same person who paid for the portrait below (Holsinger labelled the portraits by the name of the payee in his business ledgers): "Washington Ellsworth, driver Samuel J Robinson & Sons, h\[ome\] 702 Page" (p.186).

Additionally, the J. F. Bell Funeral Home database has an entry about an Ellsworth Washington (note the alternate spelling of the first name) that may be the same person as he whom paid for the portrait below: "Ellsworth Washington; born March 9, 1896 in Washington D. C. to parents William & Mary (Grigsby) Washington; spouse Lemmie; died October 7, 1936 in Charlottesville Virginia; buried in Lincoln Cemetery." 

Additional information about Elsworth Washington will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
