"Mrs. W. B. Forsythe," two photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on October 12, 1915.

Note in the second portrait the hand of the mother or nurse supporting the infant. The relationship between the woman and infant is not known, although it is possible that she may be the nurse who had her portrait taken separately from the infant. Photos of the nurse and/or infant are common in this time period, and Holsinger took several (see for instance, [Mrs. Hugh Davis](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1556 "Davis, Mrs. Hugh"), [U. H. Magee](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/2020 "Magee, U. H."), [Mr. Trotter](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1325 "Mr. Trotter"), [J. E. Shepherd](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1922 "J. E. Shepherd"), [Margaret Lewis/Mrs. Shepherd](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1323 "Margaret Lewis / Mrs. Shepherd")). 

Additional information about Mrs. W. B. Forsythe will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
