<p>Wyatt (last name unknown), adult male. He is mentioned in the Proctor's Daybook in an entry that details his being hired out to Dr. Robley Dunglison, Chairman&nbsp;(<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43624" target="_blank" title="P43624">P43624</a>),&nbsp;although it is unclear who owns Wyatt (presumably the Proctor and/or university): "Dr. Dunglison draft to Labour acct. for 49 days work of Wyatt, $22.00" (July 7, 1826).&nbsp;Dunglison lived in Pavilion X (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8474#m1" target="_blank" title="PL8474">PL8474</a>) at the time (from 1825 to 1833).</p>
