Wyatt (last name unknown), adult male. He is mentioned in the Proctor's Daybook in an entry that details his being hired out to Dr. Robley Dunglison, Chairman ([P43624](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43624 "P43624")), although it is unclear who owns Wyatt (presumably the Proctor and/or university): "Dr. Dunglison draft to Labour acct. for 49 days work of Wyatt, $22.00" (July 7, 1826). Dunglison lived in Pavilion X ([PL8474](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8474#m1 "PL8474")) at the time (from 1825 to 1833).
