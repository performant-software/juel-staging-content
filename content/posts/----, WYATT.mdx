Wyatt (last name unknown), adult male. He is mentioned in the Proctor's Daybook in an entry that details his being hired out to Dr. Robley Dunglison, Chairman ([P43624](/en/people/f4611856-1ec5-42c1-9d79-b0cec3bd17b1 "P43624")), although it is unclear who owns Wyatt (presumably the Proctor and/or university): "Dr. Dunglison draft to Labour acct. for 49 days work of Wyatt, $22.00" (July 7, 1826). Dunglison lived in Pavilion X ([PL8474](/en/places/4572f8fd-f5e2-47c8-9925-0533f3e70e03#m1 "PL8474")) at the time (from 1825 to 1833).
