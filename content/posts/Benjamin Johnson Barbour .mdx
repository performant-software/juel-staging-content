<p>Benjamin Johnson Barbour (1821-1894), a prominent speaker, planter, and rector of the Board of Visitors from 1866-1872, grew up in Orange, Va. Johnson came from a line of great success, with one relative a governor and another a Supreme Court justice. Barbour studied at the University of Virginia before spending much time as a farmer and Episcopal leader. By 1860, he supervised one of the largest estates in Orange with 7,000 acres and around 150 enslaved laborers. Johnson had Whig and Unionist ties but took no stance during the war. He was elected to Congress after the conflict but had little support since he was from an ex-Confederate state. During his time on the Board and as president of the University of Virginia, he took an active role in steering the curriculum towards a more political focus. He also helped establish many of the STEM programs at early UVA, such as applied math, chemistry, and civil engineering. He was elected to the House of Delegates in 1879, where he continued to deal with education policy and administration. He died in 1894 at what is now Barboursville.</p>
