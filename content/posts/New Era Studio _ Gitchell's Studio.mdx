The New Era Studio (also referred to as Gitchell's Studio) was a photography studio located at **403 E Main Street**, Charlottesville. The exact years of its operation are not yet known; it was in operation during 1914-15, as evident from information in the Charlottesville City Directory. Note that earlier, in 1905, **[Seabrook Bros.](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1164 "Seabrook Bros. Advertisement, 1905-6")** ([CB1143](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=CB1143 "CB1143")) Studio was also located at 403 E. Main Street, Charlottesville.

This photograph by Holsinger, interestingly enough, shows the building signage for the New Era Studio. The photograph is entitled, "Reynolds-Zink Hardware Company Charlottesville" and was taken on July 14, 1916 - whether the company was still in business or not, however, is still to be confirmed.
