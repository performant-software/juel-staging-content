"Flossie Brooks," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on September 04, 1916.

The 1910 census lists the following about a Flossie Brooks; it may or may not be about the same girl as photographed below (although the apparent age of the girl in the portrait does seem to match with the age in 1910): "Flossie Brooks, age 10, black, birth place Virginia; can read and write and attended school the previous year; house number 201, family number 132, residence 10th St. Charlottesville." More information is needed to determine whether this information is about the girl photographed below.

  
Additional information about Flossie Brooks will be added as it is researched.  
  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
