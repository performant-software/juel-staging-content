"Cora Murray," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on January 24, 1915.

The Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 states the following about a woman named Cora Murray (possibly the same individual): "Murray, Cora B. teacher Jefferson School h\[ome\] 313 6th S W" (p.142). 

Additional information about Cora Murray will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Cora Murray](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042978/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Cora Murray")
