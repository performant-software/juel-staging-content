"T. C. Hawkins," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 03, 1915.  
  
It appears that T. C. Hawkins is in the group portrait also by Holsinger, labelled "[J. P. Hawkins](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1307 "Hawkins, J. P.")."   
  
A second photograph (X03393A1) is also labelled, "T. C. Hawkins"; the relationship between the two subjects is unclear.

Additional information about T. C. Hawkins / the subjects in both photographs will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
