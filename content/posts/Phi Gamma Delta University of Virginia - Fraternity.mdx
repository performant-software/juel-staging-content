"Phi Gamma Delta University of Virginia - Fraternity," three photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on February 21, 1916, February 24, 1917, and February 23, 1919. 

The three photographs show members of the Phi Gamma Delta ([CB0392](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=392#m1 "Phi Gamma Delta University of Virginia - Fraternity")) at a banquet/function, with servers standing in the background. 

In the 1916 photograph (X03898B), there are six servers, all African American. 

In the 1917 photograph (X04862B), there are five servers, four of whom are African American.

The last photograph, dated 1919 (X04862B), shows three servers, all of whom are African American.

These photographs are included here in that, although not a posed studio portrait of African Americans, they do show actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play. They are highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment. It is particularly interesting in that not all the servers are African American.

More details will be added as they are found.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
