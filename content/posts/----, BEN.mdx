Ben, male (last name unknown), described as an "old man." He was mentioned in a March 10, 1831 Chairman's Journal entry: "Some of Mr. Rose's boarders kept a servant. The proctor informed me that he understood some of Mr. Rose’s ([P43866](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43866 "P43866")) boarders had joined to keep a servant. On inquiring it appeared that nine of them had clubbed half a dollar a month for the services of an old man named Ben. He was ordered away from the premises." 

Captain John N. Rose, at that time, was the Hotelkeeper for Hotel D ([PL8435](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8435 "PL8435")). Although Rose was not the owner of Ben, it is not clear from whom the students had hired him.
