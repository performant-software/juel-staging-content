Originally from Winchester, Virginia, he was from a family of prominence as his uncle (and namesake) was an author and judge and his father and brother were both Congressmen. Tucker requested to matriculate the summer before but faced difficulties—along with several other students—when he failed to bring a certificate from his prior education or other “satisfactory evidence of good character.” However, he was able to enter the University in the schools of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Moral Philosophy.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to his education at UVA, however, he attended Richmond Academy—of Richmond, Virginia, not to be confused with the one of Augusta, Georgia—which opened its doors in October of 1835. Mr. Socrates Maupin, a University of Virginia alumus himself, was elected as the principle of the new school in June of the opening year. A newspaper article from “The Richmond Whig” even expressed its foreseen success: “Every father in the city, ought to feel a particular and individual interest in its welfare: and to promote that, should remember that the City, through the agency of its public opinion, more than the professors themselves, will controul its character.” Interestingly enough, it seems that all levels of education at the time faced difficulties in taming the rowdy natures of young white male students. Today, it seems as though the all-male school no longer exists, at least not by its original name.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beverly Tucker was no exception to the rambunctiousness. Throughout his year at the University, he was reprimanded by the faculty on several occasions, including: hosting a festival entertainment (eating party), intoxication at a student ball, and violating the “law regarding early rising.” His father was written to and he was suspended at one point during the year as punishment.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After his time at UVA, Tucker founded the Washington Sentinel in 1853. Later the same year, he was elected printer of the United States Senate. As the Civil War approached, he joined the Confederacy and was sent to England and France as an economic agent while also involving himself in other questionably legitimate deal-making. A member of the Union’s “Wanted List” (he was tied with plans to assassinate Lincoln), he fled to Mexico until the end of the war. After changing his residence and traveling internationally for several years, he finally returned to the United States and died July 15, 1890.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="panels-flexible-row-3-main-row-right">&nbsp;</div></div></div></div></div><div class="panel-flexible panels-flexible-3 clearfix"><div class="panel-flexible panels-flexible-3 clearfix"><div class="panel-flexible-inside panels-flexible-3-inside"><div class="panels-flexible-row panels-flexible-row-3-image_region panels-flexible-row-first panels-flexible-row-last clearfix"><div class="inside panels-flexible-row-inside panels-flexible-row-3-image_region-inside panels-flexible-row-inside-first panels-flexible-row-inside-last clearfix"><div class="panels-flexible-row-3-main-row-middle"><div class="panels-flexible-region panels-flexible-region-3-center panels-flexible-region-first "><div class="inside panels-flexible-region-inside panels-flexible-region-3-center-inside panels-flexible-region-inside-first"><div class="contextual-links-region panel-pane pane-custom pane-1"><div class="pane-content"><p><em>Nathaniel Beverly Tucker, A Notable Alumnus </em><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by Meredith Stanley</p></div></div><div class="panel-pane pane-token pane-node-field-essay-text juel-essay-content"><div class="pane-content"><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathaniel Beverly Tucker (b. 8 June 1820) was a first year at the University during the 1837-1838 session.
