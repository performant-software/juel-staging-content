"Willie Chaplin," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 21, 1916. 

This portrait is particularly interesting in showing details of the studio setup, with not just the backdrop, but also the studio door in the background.  

Additional information about Willie Chaplin will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
