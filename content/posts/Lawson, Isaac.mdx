"Isaac Lawson," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 7, 1917.

Note the second photograph (ID X05371A) is missing from the library catalogue (although it is described as a portrait of a child). 

From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"This is the barber who would cut your hair at Radio Barber Shop down on Vinegar Hill on Main Street." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.  

Additional information about Isaac Lawson will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
