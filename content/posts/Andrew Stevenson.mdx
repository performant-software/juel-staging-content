<p>Stevenson (1784-1857), member of the Board of Visitors from 1845-1857, attended William and Mary&#39;s School of Law and served on the House of Delegates from 1809-1821. He was then elected to the House of Representatives from 1825-1833 and served as Speaker beginning in 1827, before becoming US Minister to the UK from 1836-1841. As minister, he faced much backlash from British officials and the abolitionist movement, including a confrontation with Irish political figure Daniel O&rsquo;Connell.
