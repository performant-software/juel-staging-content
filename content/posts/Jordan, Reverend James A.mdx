"Reverand J. A. Jordan," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on April 5, 1915. The subject is likely Reverand James A. Jordan.

From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"Reverand James Jordan was a street preacher who would go around to people's houses, and they would also go door to door with the collection plate. He would preach in front of 401 5th St. SW and at the top of the hill at 205 5th St. SW and in Vinegar Hill." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.  

Additional information about Reverend J. A. Jordan will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Jordan, Reverend James A.](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1043179/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Jordan, Reverend James A.")
