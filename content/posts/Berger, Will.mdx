"Will Berger," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 21, 1916 and August 13, 1917.

From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"Will Berger was a milkman who worked for Monticello Dairy. He delivered milk to the house every morning. (- Melvin Flannagan Jr.) The milk trucks were pulled by horses. Wages in those days were $1 per day which was big money." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day. 

Additional information about the subjects in the photographs will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
