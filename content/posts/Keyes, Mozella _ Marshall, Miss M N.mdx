"Mozella Keyes," photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 9th, 1915. (Named spelled elsewhere Mozelle Keys). The same subject is seen in a photograph labelled "Miss M. N. Marshall."

The Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 lists the following about a "Mozella Keys"; it may or may not be the same individual as photographed (to be determined): "Keys Mozella, dom\[estic\] h\[ome\] 308th N W." Living at the same address are "Keys Eugene, lab" and "Keys Frank, butler" (p119). Note the variations in spelling: Key, Keys, Keyes. [Eugene Keys](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1315 "Eugene Keys") ([P48335](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48335 "P48335")) was also photographed by Holsinger. 

From the same Directory, a "Miss Mollie Marshall" lived in Belmont (Monticello Rd. near Douglas Ave.), as did a widow, Miss Mary Marshall (Belmont Ave. near Monticello Rd.); perhaps the subject of the second portrait below? (p.132). 

Additional information about Mozella Keyes / Miss M. N. Marshall will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
