"Ruben Gordon," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on September 10, 1917.

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home database lists a "Reuben Gordon" (note different spelling of first name): "Reuben Gordon, born October 18, 1884 in Greenwood, Virginia to parents Reuben and Isabelle Gordon; spouse Elizabeth; died October 1 1949 in Crozet, Virginia and buried in Piedmont Cemetery. More information is needed to verify if this is the same individual as photographed below.

Additional information about Ruben Gordon will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Gordon, Ruben](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1048500/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Gordon, Ruben")
