Sally Whiting, female, former slave. Her daughter is Ruth ([P49036](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=49036 "P49036")). What is known of Sally Whiting thus far is from the May 19, 1867 letter she wrote to Nannie C. Minor ([P48204](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48204 "P48204")), the relation of Professor John Barbee Minor ([P22874](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=22874 "P22874")). She wrote from her place of employment at the home of Mrs. Allen Williams ([P48930](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48930 "P48930")) in Berryville ([PL4247](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=4247 "PL4247")), Clarke County Virginia.

In the letter, Sally details how an injury has rendered her right hand and foot paralysed and that her daughter Ruth ([P49036](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=49036 "P49036")) is herself burdened with her own children, and so asks Nannie whether she may live with her or whether she can provide any assistance:

> I took care of you, Miss Nannie, when you were weak & helpless & now you must take care of old Aunt Sally. – that is if the Lord has blessed you with enough & to spare. I would love to spend (p.3) the rest of my days with you, - I w\[oul\]d try to make myself useful in any little ways I could. – but I do feel very helpless out on the world – Ruth can barely take care of herself and her children, and I do feel that I am a heavy \[burden?\] on her.

She ends the letter by imploring, "Now dear Miss Nannie please write to your Old Nanny and Humble Servant, Sally Whiting."
