Holsinger taken on October 19, 1918.</p><p>Note that a very similar-looking woman appears in the portrait labelled "<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1939" target="_blank" title="Williams, Maude">Maude Williams</a>," also taken on the same date. The women hold the same small purse and wear the same hat in both portraits, and also have a similar outfit on. Perhaps they are sisters; more information is needed to determine their relationship.&nbsp;Perhaps they are related (by birth or marriage); more information is needed, however, to determine their relationship. Additionally, a young woman named&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1638" target="_blank" title="Dowell, Fannie">Fannie Dowell</a>&nbsp;also appears in a very similar pose, seated in the same chair; this portrait was also taken on October 19, 1918. The portraits of the three women are labelled consecutively as well: Maude Williams (X06858A), Hattie Williams (X06859A), and Fanny Dowell (X06860A). They may have went to the studio together, for instance.&nbsp;</p><p>Additional information about Hattie Williams will be added as it is researched.</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049900/full/561,778/0/default.jpg" alt="Williams, Hattie" title="Williams, Hattie" width="561" height="778" /><br /></em><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/sources/images/items/uva-lib:1049900" target="_blank" title="Williams, Hattie">Hattie Williams</a>," 1918-10-19 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X06859A)&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
