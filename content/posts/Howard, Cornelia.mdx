"Cornelia Howard," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 02, 1914.

The following is excerpted from The Washington Herald, January 19, 1918: "On Wednesday, January 16, 1918, at 11:30 o'clock p.m., after a short illness, which she bore with Christian faith, CORNELIA HOWARD, beloved mother of Harrison Howard, Edward Howard, Bessie Tyler (nee Howard) and Ada Howard and grandmother of James Howard and Cornelius Heyler."

Cornelia Howard is buried at the Daughters of Zion Cemetery in Charlottesville, VA.

Additional information about Cornelia Howard will be added as it is researched.   

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Howard, Cornelia](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042574/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Howard, Cornelia")
