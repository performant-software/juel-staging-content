"John Key," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 27, 1912.

From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"John Key was a trombone player. He lived at 401 5th St. SW. John Key also worked for the C & O Railroad - he worked in the icing station." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.  

The Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 lists three John Keys; each may or may not be the same as the individual photographed (to be determined): "Key John, lab h\[ome\] 1013 Page"; "Key John, waiter h\[ome\] 856 Cox's Row"; "Key John B, ydmstr So Ry h\[ome\] 331 7 1/2 S W" (p.119).

Additional information about John Key will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
