"Felix Bland," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on December 31, 1913.

The Charlottesville City Directory of 1914-15 has the following entry about a Felix Bland: 

"V-pres\[ident\] Charlottesville Colored Agricultural & Industrial Fair Association, 280 W\[est\] Main" (p.45); "Charlottesville Colored Agricultural & Industrial Fair Association, 280 W Main, [W A Millner](/en/people/a21d2676-ba95-4cc5-8d96-1cd76b909fd6# "W. A. Millner") ([P48333](/en/people/a21d2676-ba95-4cc5-8d96-1cd76b909fd6 "P48333")) pres, Felix Bland v-pres, J G Shelton sec-mgr, Charles Hopkins treas\[urer\]" (p.62). 

It also lists his home as 410 Dice Street, and that he was a clothier with a shop at 275 West Main Street (p.62). 

Elizabeth Bland, living at 410 Dice Street, is listed as a Retail Grocer in the Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 (p.45) (grocery located at 307 5th S W). Likely she is the spouse of Felix Bland.

Additional information about Felix Bland will be added as it is researched.  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
