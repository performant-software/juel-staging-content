"Bennie Palmer," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on March 19, 1912.  
  
The Charlottesville Census of 1910 has an entry for a Ben Palmer that may be about the individual photographed below: ¨Ben Palmer, 19, male, black, born in Virginia; single; can read and write but did not attend school in the past year; servant living in employer´s household; occupation house boy - private house; family number 359; residing at 359 Park Street.¨ The apparent age of the individual photographed below does seem to align with the recorded age in the census entry (21 in 1912); it does seem likely it could refer to the same individual but more information is needed to verify.

Additional information about Bennie Palmer will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Palmer, Bennie](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1039824/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Palmer, Bennie")
