"Leola Garland," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on September 26, 1917.

The young woman below looks similar to the younger girl, "[Lena](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/993 "Lena")," photographed by Holsinger on January 4, 1912. It is possible it is the same woman, or, they may be related; more information is needed to verify this, however.  

Additional information about Leola Garland will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
