"Horace Miller," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 23, 1915.

A Horace Miller is mentioned in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database; it may or may not be the same person as the one photographed below: "Horace Miller, born December 28, 1891 in Albemarle County Virginia to parents Thomas Miller and Mary Clark; died June 25, 1982 in Earlysville Virginia and buried at Mount Zion Baptist Church Cemetery in Earlysville; spouse Julia C. Miller; sons Horace, Ralph, Harold, Eugene, and Robert Miller; daughters Margaret Griffin, Elizabeth Scott, Edith Callahan, Ruth Thomas, Mary Ann Carney, Madeline Dudley, and Sarah Morton." More information is needed to determine if this information applies to the Horace Miller photographed.

Additional information about Horace Miller will be added as it is researched.

NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Miller, Horace](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1043556/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Miller, Horace")
