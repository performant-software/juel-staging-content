<p>Fielding, male (last name unknown), servant of Prof. Charles Bonnycastle (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43623" title="P43623">P43623</a>). The Faculty Minutes and Chairman's Journals describe at great length the beating of Fielding by university students on the afternoon of Sunday, February 24, 1839; the accounts include testimony from the students involved, witnesses, Professors, and Charles Bonnycastle himself, and discuss at length the affront to Bonnycastle (and, less so, the beating of Fielding) and the disciplining of the students involved.</p>
<p>Although it has not yet been established when Fielding was first hired by Bonnycastle, it is known that he was part of Bonnycastle's household at the time of his death on October 31, 1840 (as recorded in his <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/538" title="Estate Appraisement">Estate Appraisement of 1841</a>). &nbsp;</p>
