"Robert Gosham," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on April 8, 1912.

It is possible that the last name is Goshorn, not Gosham (either it was originally misspelled at the time of payment for the photograph, or, was mistranscribed when entered in the library catalogue).

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home database has information about a Robert Goshorn and his spouse; it may or may not be about the couple photographed: "Nannie Goshorn, birth date unknown; born in Charlottesville, Virginia to parents William Battles and Nancy Farrar; date of death November 25, 1920; place of death 205 6th St N W Charlottesville VA; place of burial Oakwood Cemetery; spouse Robert Goshorn" (aged  "about 53" at death). 

Additional information about Robert Gosham will be added as it is researched.  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).__![Gosham, Robert](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1039872/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Gosham, Robert")_
