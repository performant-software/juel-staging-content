<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Joseph C. Cabell (1778-1856) served as a Member and Rector of the Board of Visitors from 1825-1853. He also spent time in the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates from 1818-1832 and 1834-35. As a Jeffersonian Republican, he was a close friend of Jefferson and St. George Tucker, under whom he studied law. After the war, he played a key role in funding the charter for the University of Virginia and even blocked a move of William and Mary College to Richmond which he felt would threaten the position of UVa. He also planned a prep school in Nelson County in the 1820s, and this pursuit inspired the development of Randolph-Macon College in the late 1830s. Cabell also played a prominent role in the James River and Kanawha Company, serving as its first president and lobbied the House of Delegates for its westward expansion of the canal in 1831. Cabellâ€™s tight connections to both the corporate world of westward expansion and to the Virginia legislature helped to establish the University and build the canal in the early to mid 1800s.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /> &nbsp;</p>
