J. Parr &amp; Son," labelled, "Parr Wholesale House Charlottesville," photographed by R. W. Holsinger. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The exterior shot shows signage reading, "W. J. Parr &amp; Son&nbsp;Feed &amp; Groceries," "Poultry Supplies," "Hay, Grain, Flour, Meal", etc.</span></p><p><span>The 1914-15 Charlottesville City Directory provides additional information about the business. William J. Parr&nbsp;and son Irving&nbsp;were listed as owners: </span>"Parr W J &amp; Son [William J and Irvine W], feed 400-404 E Market", "W J P &amp; Son" (p147).</p><p><span>Additional information about the store and the individuals will be added as it is researched. Note the two African-American men at the far right of the photograph (in black vest, standing before the door, and the other man standing in the horse cart).</span></p><p><span>This photograph is included here in that, although not a posed studio portrait of African Americans, it shows actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play. It is highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><i>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</i></p><p><span>In this instance, the title does refer to the building (the persons photographed are not verified in terms of identity).<br /><br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1044153/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Parr Wholesale House Charlottesville" title="Parr Wholesale House Charlottesville" width="778" height="561" /><br /></span><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1044153#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=-911%2C532%2C7057%2C5232" target="_blank" title="Parr Wholesale House Charlottesville">Parr Wholesale House Charlottesville</a>," 1916-05-30 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X04172B)&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans<br /><br /></a></p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
