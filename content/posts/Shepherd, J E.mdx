JUEL ID/KEY: 

"J. E. Shepherd," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 07, 1915.

The portrait is included here in that you can see the hand of (presumably) the nanny in assisting the infants.  

Interestingly, John E. Shepherd was the employer of another nanny, [Margaret Lewis](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1323 "Lewis, Margaret"), who was photographed by Holsinger holding an infant in 1914 (note: Ms. Lewis died on February 27, 1915, and so isn't in the photo below).

Photos of the nurse and/or infant are common in this time period, and Holsinger took several (see for instance, [Mrs. Hugh Davis](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1556 "Davis, Mrs. Hugh"), [Mrs. W. B. Forsythe](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1655 "Forsythe, Mrs. W. B."), [U. H. Magee](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/2020 "Magee, U. H."), [Mr. Trotter](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1325 "Mr. Trotter"), [Margaret Lewis/Mrs. Shepherd](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1323 "Margaret Lewis / Mrs. Shepherd")). 

Additional information about J. E. Shepherd/ the subjects photographed  will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![J. E. Shepherd](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1043438/full/561,778/0/default.jpg "J. E. Shepherd")
