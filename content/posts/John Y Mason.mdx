<p>John Young Mason (1799-1859) served on the Board of Visitors from 1851-1853, but his career originally took off in 1823 upon election to the House of Delegates and eventually the Virginia Senate in 1827. Mason&rsquo;s major public service was to the United States Navy. He was appointed as Secretary in 1844 by President Polk. Under Mason&rsquo;s oversight, the Navy simplified systems, expanded scientific research, and established naval engineers. Mason also led the Navy during the Mexican War in 1846, commanding the construction of new steamers. He ended his professional career as a member of the Board of Visitors and as US Ambassador to France from 1854-1859.</p>
