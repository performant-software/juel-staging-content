Primus, male, last name unknown. He is mentioned alongside Humphry ([P47035](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47035 "P47035")), both of whom were hired out to the university by James Nelson ([P47034](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47034 "P47034")) for 40.00$ each (January 1, 1824), and 35.00$ each (January 4, 1825). Likely they were also the "2 hands" of James Nelson hired for 35.00$ on February 18, 1826.
