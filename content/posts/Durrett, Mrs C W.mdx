JUEL ID/KEY: 

"Mrs. C. W. Durrett," five photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on August 06, 1916.

Of interest in the photograph is the unidentified African American man and (presumably) his wife standing with the group; possibly they were family employees. They are purposefully included in four of the five family photos, which certainly shows their importance to the family.

The identity of the African American man and woman is not yet known.   
  
Similar group portraits that show a family gathering (for wedding, anniversary, or just for posterity's sake) in front of the family home, while also purposefully including the African American employees, are: "[Mrs. B. Bowling](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1494 "Bowling, Mrs. B. ")" and "[Golden Wedding Anniversary, Moss](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1923 "Golden Wedding Anniversary, Moss")."  
  
Additional information about the Durrett family / the African American man and woman photographed will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
