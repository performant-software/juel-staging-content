Dick (last name unknown), adult male, is mentioned in student Charles Ellis's Diary. Ellis, who boarded at Hotel E while at the University in 1835-6, mentions servant Dick or "Old Dick." It is unclear who owned Dick, though likely he worked for Hotel E, which was owned by Mrs. Sarah Carter Gray ([P43865](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43865#m1 "P43865")) at the time. In an entry dated Sunday December 6, 1835, Ellis writes, ". . .Dick then brought me a snack had several men in to assist-me in demolishing it, which was quickenly done, but getting rid of my visitors was not so easily done. . ." Next, on Thursday December 31, 1835, Ellis writes, "Was rather mortified on finding that I had slept till nearly nine O’clock and thereby lost my breakfast, however took it in pretty good humor, and after having dressed, ordered a breakfast from old Dick, a famous hand for procuring suppers, snacks, and other such articles of a student’s wants."
