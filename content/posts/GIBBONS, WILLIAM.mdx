William Gibbons, male, a prominent individual in the Charlottesville community. Spouse of [Isabella Gibbons](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/400 "GIBBONS, ISABELLA") ([P44625](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=44625 "P44625")). William was employed by Prof. William McGuffey ([P43668](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43668 "P43668")), who lived in Pavilion IX ([PL8470](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8470 "PL8470")) from 1845 to 1873, and was owned by Henry Howard ([P43670](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43670 "P43670")).

Details about her later life (marriage, residence, death) are not as clear. William Gibbons was the Minister of the First Baptist Church, Charlottesville after 1863; in 1868, he was the Minister at the Zion Baptist Church in Washington D.C. ("Behind Her Eyes"). William Gibbons was buried at Charlottesville's Oakwood Cemetery; Isabella Gibbons is believed to be buried in an unmarked grave near her husband (accordingly, Isabella is not listed as a person buried at Oakwood; William's gravestone is below):
