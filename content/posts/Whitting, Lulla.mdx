"Lulla Whitting," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on September 27, 1918.

Photographs of [Lily Whitting](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1917 "Lily Whitting") and of [Everette Whitting](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1916 "Whitting, Everette") were also taken on September 27, 1918. The portrait ID for Lily is X06784A; for Everette, X06785A; and for Lulla, X06783A. Based on their having the same last name, same date, and the consecutive order of the IDs (as entered in Holsinger's ledger), it is highly likely Everette, Lily, and Lulla came together to the portrait studio (although they were not photographed together in one portrait). The relationship between the three individuals is not yet known.

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home database has an entry about a Louella Whitting that may or may not be the same person as photographed below: "Louella Thomas Whitting, born December 25 1861 at Miller's School (outside Crozet, Virginia); mother Elvira Thomas; died November 28 1945 at Miller's School Virginia; buried at Hillsboro Virignia; informant Lelia Myrick." The estimated age (and the similar name) of the subject makes it possible that the database record matches the woman below, but further research is needed.

Additional information about Lulla Whitting will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Whitting, Lulla](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049806/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Whitting, Lulla")**Sources**
