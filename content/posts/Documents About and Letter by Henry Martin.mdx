<p>1) The following is a transcript of the letter dictated to C. Francis Cocke by Henry Martin (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=46982" title="Henry Martin">P46982</a>), 1909:</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>This letter was dictated to C[f] Cocke by uncle Henry Martin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I came to the Univ. of Virginia (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=CB0001" title="University of Virginia">CB0001</a>) in 1848. I was nineteen years old at that time. I had a letter concerning my character from my master, Dr. Carr, this letter was given to the second Proctor, Col. Kemper (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43707" title="Col. Kemper">P43707</a>). Dr. Carr bought me, my mother, and twin brother at Thos Jefferson's (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P43611" title="Thomas Jefferson">P43611</a>)&nbsp;sale which took place six months after Mr. Jefferson's death. I came here while I was quite a boy, and I have always tried to behave myself and I have always been obedient and honest. I have served [nine] Proctors and twenty eight professors. Prof. H. H. Smith&nbsp;(<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43721" title="Prof. H. H. Smith">P43721</a>) is the only professor here now who was there when I first came to the University. I am probably more widely known than any other colored man in the United States especially by the students who have been at the University while I have been there. No doubt when I quit another Henry may fill my place but it won't be the same Henry that has had the job for so long a time. Prof. Minor&nbsp;(<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=22874" title="Prof. Minor">P22874</a>) and Dr. Maupin (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43731" title="Dr. Maupin">P43721</a>)&nbsp;said that I was the most prompt man that they ever saw. Thunder and lightning don't stop me. I come (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8575" title="PL8575">PL8575</a>) every morning and always get up at four o'clock."</p>
<p>Feb. 15th, 1909</p>

<p>2) This letter is regarding the Rotunda key kept by Henry Martin:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>March 24, 1949</p>
<p>Mr. Colgate W. Darden, President<br />University of Virginia<br /><br />Charlottesville, Virginia</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Darden:<br />It was always the wish of my Father that this Key be returned to the University. He had hoped during the past few years of his life to be able to come down and present it to you personally, but such was not to be. The Key is the one to the original Rotunda which burned in 1895 and was presented to Father as a graduation present by Henry Martin, the janitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Henry told Father that he had carried it for thirty years, and felt that it was the only graduation present that he could give Father that would have any real value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ribbon around the Key is part of the ribbon attached to the whistle my Father used while leading the Germans during his student days at the University. On the back of the frame is a short note in my Father's handwriting telling who gave him the key and signed by Henry Martin with his mark and witnessed by Mr. Grice who was a student at the University at that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is with a great deal of pleasure that I present this Key to the University and am able to carry out my Father's wishes. I trust that all who see it will be reminded of the spirit and devotion and high principals that were the basis of this institution as conceived by Thomas Jefferson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With kindest personal regards,&nbsp;<br />Very truly yours,&nbsp;</p>
