"May Moore," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on November 04, 1916.

A May Moore is listed in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database; it may or may not be the same person as the one photographed below: "May Lillie Moore, died April 30, 1949 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania; buried in Charlottesville, Virginia, estimated age at death 46." The estimated age would put May at age 13, if she were photographed in 1916. More information is needed to determine the identity of the young woman. 

Additional information about May Moore will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
