Mary Collins is mentioned once in the Proctor's Daybook, in an entry from February 7, 1824. She presumably was a tailor: the entry records $2.00 for "Labour account for drft. to Js. [\[James\] Brockman](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/626 "BROCKMAN, JAMES") ([P47208](/en/people/fdfc0037-6d7b-4522-b63d-11d8ea82b1cf "P47208")) for this sum for Mary Collins for making clothes for Laborer."
