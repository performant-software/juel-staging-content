Mary Collins is mentioned once in the Proctor's Daybook, in an entry from February 7, 1824. She presumably was a tailor: the entry records $2.00 for "Labour account for drft. to Js. [\[James\] Brockman](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/626 "BROCKMAN, JAMES") ([P47208](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47208 "P47208")) for this sum for Mary Collins for making clothes for Laborer."
