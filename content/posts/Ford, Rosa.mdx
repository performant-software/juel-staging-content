"Rosa Ford," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 19, 1915.

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database has information on a Rosa Ford; it may or may not be the same person as photographed: Rosa Bell Ford, born in Albemarle City to parents Miles Cary and Betsy (date not recorded); spouse Willis; died April 24, 1929 in Esmont, Virginia. 

Additional information about Rosa Ford will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
