"Tom Moore," two photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on October 25, 1917.

The identity of the subjects is unknown, but the man and woman in the first portrait below are also the same man and woman in the portrait labelled, "[Mamie Payne](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1664 "Payne, Mamie")," and the photo itself is a duplicate, taken on the same date. The identity of the man in the second portrait below is also unknown. 

Additional information about Tom Moore / the subjects photographed will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
