"Percy Payne," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on November 11, 1916.

  
A Percy Pane is listed in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database: born January 9, 1896 in Albemarle County to parents Robert and Gertrude Payne; died April 4, 1986 in Cleveland, Ohio and buried in Oakwood Cemetery; spouse Mary Josephine Bowles and sister Florence MacMurray, and children Percy Payne, Constance Anderson, and Susan Payne. 

Based on the date of the portrait, the subjects could possibly be of a young Percy Payne and his spouse or sister, although it is not yet certain.

Additional information about Percy Payne will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._ ![Payne, Percy](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1044746/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Payne, Percy")
