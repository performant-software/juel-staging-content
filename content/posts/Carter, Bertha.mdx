"Bertha Carter," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 31, 1915.

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database lists a Bertha Carter: "Bertha Carter born July 10 1896 in Union Mills Virginia to parents David and Willie Hughes McGruder; died April 9, 1940 and buried in Shiloh Cemetery. Spouse W. J. Carter." Further information is needed to determine whether this entrant is the same woman as the one photographed below.

Additional information about Bertha Carter will be added as it is researched.  
  
_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
