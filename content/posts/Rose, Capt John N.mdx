Capt. John N. Rose, Sr. was a hotelkeeper in the Academical Village, running Hotel F ([PL8437](/en/places/953a23cd-0548-41dc-8888-f35cfd231379#m1 "PL8437")) from 1829-1833 and Hotel D ([PL8436](/en/places/ed8eb486-7e3c-48cc-a16c-3e4824ad6924 "PL8436")) from July 1833-4. 

As hotelkeeper, Capt. Rose would have been in charge of the several slaves needed for running the boarding house and dining room.
