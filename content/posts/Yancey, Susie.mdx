"Susie Yancey," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on March 4, 1915. 

Information about a Susie (Cinders) Yancey is listed in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database; it may or may not be about the woman photographed below: "Willie J Yancey, born September 4 1922 in Virginia to parents Grant Yancey and Susie Cinders." More information is needed. 

Additional information about Susie Yancey will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Yancey, Susie](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1043069/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Yancey, Susie")
