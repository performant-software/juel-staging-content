"Humane Society Charlottesville," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on January 9, 1915. 

The photograph shows two women (with a flyer labelled "Hmane Calendar") and a young African-American boy. They are located at the West Main Street bridge, Charlottesville.

This photograph is included here in that, although not a posed studio portraits of African Americans, it does show actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play. The image is thus highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment. 

Additional information about the individuals will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._ ![Humane Society Charlottesville](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042960/full/2000,/0/default.jpg "Humane Society Charlottesville")
