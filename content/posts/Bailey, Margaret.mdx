"Margaret Bailey," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on November 2, 1918.

See also "[Myrtle Williams](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1940 "Williams, Myrtle")," a portrait taken on the same date, with the young woman posed in a similar fashion and wearing the same hat. 

 Additional information about Margaret Bailey will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
