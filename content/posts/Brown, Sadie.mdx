"Sadie Brown," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on November 10, 1916.

The 1910 Census has information about a Sadie Brown; this may or may not refer to the same individual as photographed below: "Sadie Brown, age 18, mulatto, born in Virginia; occupation: none; married, three children; married 4 years; dwelling number 163; on north/south road to Keene in Scottsville district (Albemarle county)." If this entry is about the same individuals, the woman below would be 24 in the portriat below. More information is needed.

Additional information about Sadie Brown will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
