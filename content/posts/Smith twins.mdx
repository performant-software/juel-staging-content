Untitled ("Smith twins"), a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 10, 1914.

From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"These are the Smith twins - this picture was taken during World War One."- Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.  

Additional information about the Smith twins will be added as it is researched. \*Note: the image is labelled "untitled" in the Holsinger catalogue, and so can't be found if searching by the name "Smith" (use ID #X02695A).

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
