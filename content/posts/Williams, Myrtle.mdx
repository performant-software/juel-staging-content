"Myrtle Williams," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on November 02, 1918.

See also "[Margaret Bailey](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1515 "Bailey, Margaret")," a portrait taken on the same date, with the young woman posed in a similar fashion and wearing the same hat. 

Additional information about Myrtle Williams will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
