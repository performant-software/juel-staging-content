"F. M. Morris," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 08, 1914.

The Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 has an entry that may be about the same person as photographed below: "Morris Frederick, lab\[orer\] h\[ome\] Preston av\[enue\] cor\[ner\] Wood" (p. 140). More information is needed. 

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database also has an entry about a Frederick Morris; it may or may not be about the same person as photographed below. The birth date does seem to align with the approximate age of the sitter. "Frederick Morris; born July 3 1873 in Albemarle County Virginia to parents Lewis Morris and Susan Wood; spouse Julia Morris; died February 3 1930 at 716 1st St. in Charlottesville Virginia, and buried in Oakwood Cemetery."

Additional information about F. M. Morris will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Morris, F. M. ](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042408/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Morris, F. M. ")
