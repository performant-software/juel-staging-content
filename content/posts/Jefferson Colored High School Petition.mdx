title: Jefferson Colored High School Petition
---
The following is a transcription of the documents of the petition to create a High School for "colored youths" in Charlottesville. They include the petition (to the Charlottesville Superintendent and School Board) and three pages of signatures. At the time, there was an elementary school through eighth grade, with those students wishing for high school education having to leave home (at significant cost). The Jefferson School with high school program offerings opened in 1926 (233 Fourth St. N. W.), at a time "when most Virginia jurisdictions failed to offer high-school education to African Americans" ([Virginia Historic Register](during%20an%20era%20when%20most%20Virginia%20jurisdictions%20failed%20to%20offer%20high-school%20education%20to%20African%20Americans "Virginia Historic Register") report). Although no dates appear on the three lists, they were created and submitted in 1894: "The City decided in 1924 to honor this request for a 'Negro' high school that would house three high school grades. Minutes for the Charlottesville School Board in November of 1924 reveal that the board was anxious to get the plans for the new colored school from the State education department architect, Mr. Raymond B. Long" ([Section 8, page 17](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/104-5087_JeffersonSchool_2005_NR_final.pdf "Jefferson School Report")).

The school building for Jefferson Colored High School was completed in 1926 (section 8, page 18). It was next to the 1894 building for the Jefferson Graded School (a four-story brick building that replaced the wood-frame Freedman's School building on the same site; it was in use through to it being demolished in 1959) ([Section 8, page 15](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/104-5087_JeffersonSchool_2005_NR_final.pdf "Jefferson Graded School")). The deed for the earlier property was dated January 27, 1894 ([SOURCE: A Guide to the Records of the Charlottesville School Board 1869-2006](https://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=uva-sc/viu04083.xml#series9 "Guide to the Charlottesville School Board")). The 1894 building faced Fourth Street NW; the high school building faced Commerce Street. The original deeds of land purchased verify the locations of the buildings:

Not only are these documents vital in showing the fought-for establishment of equal education for African-American citizens, they are also useful in telling us the names of active members of the African American community. 

**Document One**

"Whereas education will banish crime, exile idleness, drive out rudeness and make good citizens and where as the object of this goernment is to make good citizens out of its inhabitants, therefore: we the citizens of Seneca School District do humbly petition the honorable School Board of Seneca District to aid us in building a District High School near Grace Church where the colored youths may have their hands, head and hearts trained to love and bless the Old State of Virginia."
