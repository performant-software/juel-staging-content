<p>Thomas J. Randolph (1792-1875), grandson of Thomas Jefferson and Albemarle native, was part of the first Board of Visitors from 1829-1864, including Rector from 1857-1864. Randolph studied botany, history, and anatomy in both Charlottesville and Philadelphia. He completed a long career in Virginia, serving six terms on the House of Delegates, chaired the 1872 Democratic National Convention, and became a colonel in the Confederate Army. One significant action of Randolph was his emancipation proposal after Nat Turner&rsquo;s rebellion in 1831. It was defeated but its stipulations would have allowed gradual emancipation for children born of enslaved laborers after an apprenticeship.</p>
