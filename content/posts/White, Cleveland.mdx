Additional information about Cleveland White will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![White, Cleveland](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1048360/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "White, Cleveland")
