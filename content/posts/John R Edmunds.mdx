<p>John R. Edmunds (1812-1873) was born in Halifax Co., VA and attended Virginia from 1828-1831, later serving on the Board of Visitors from 1855-1864. He ran an established law practice but was also heavily involved in Virginia politics. He served in the House of Delegates from 1836-1846, 1855-1858, and during the Civil War. He played a major part during the Virginia Convention of 1850. As president of the Virginia Agricultural Society, he presided over the last Farmers&rsquo; Assembly in an attempt to unite both unions, but could not bring the state and Union societies together before the Civil War broke out.</p>
