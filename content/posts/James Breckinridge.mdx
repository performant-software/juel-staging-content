<p>Aside from his time on the Board of Visitors from 1825-1833, James Breckinridge spent much of his career in the Virginia House of Delegates and later, the US House of Representatives. His time within these legislatures spanned from 1789-1817. Breckinridge was also known for fighting the Revolutionary War from 1775-1783. Born in Fincastle, later August County, he was educated by private tutors before 1781 when he enrolled at what is now Washington and Lee College after fighting in the Revolutionary War. In 1788, he attended William and Mary Law school. He remained devoted to Fincastle, captaining the county militia and running a law practice there. He represented Botetourt County in the House of Delegates from 1789-1809 when he won a seat in the House of Representatives over Alexander Wilson. He served three terms until 1817. He held fairly Federalist views on foreign policy, opposing the War of 1812. After his time in Congress, he returned to the House of Delegates. From 1819-1829, he helped push financing for state schools and colleges as well as working on militia laws and infrastructure reform. Breckinridge died in 1833 in Grove Hill, VA.</p>
