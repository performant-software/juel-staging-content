ANON0067 (name unknown), male child of 16. He is described as a "dining room servant" by owner Mrs. Elizbaeth Cary ([P47998](/en/people/80147987-37f0-436f-8b24-935c0bd96577 "P47998")), in a letter to John Hartwell Cocke ([P43616](/en/people/c61406c9-c83a-4b8b-a093-dccb219d16cb "P43616")) dated January 13th 1828. Mrs. Cary wrote to ask whether Cocke could "try and engage him," or find employment, on her behalf: "he is about 16 years old a good dining room servant and perfectly honest. If you can get a place for him and will let me know I will send him down immediately."
