ANON0067 (name unknown), male child of 16. He is described as a "dining room servant" by owner Mrs. Elizbaeth Cary ([P47998](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47998 "P47998")), in a letter to John Hartwell Cocke ([P43616](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43616 "P43616")) dated January 13th 1828. Mrs. Cary wrote to ask whether Cocke could "try and engage him," or find employment, on her behalf: "he is about 16 years old a good dining room servant and perfectly honest. If you can get a place for him and will let me know I will send him down immediately."
