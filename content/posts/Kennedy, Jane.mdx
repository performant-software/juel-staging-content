"Jane Kennedy," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on May 6, 1914 (duplicate copies). Note the date of 1914 (likely a transcription error).  
  
From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"Mr. Kennedy was a corporeal in the army. He fought in France in \[1914\] during World War 1. He found out that life was so much better for African Americans in France, so he stayed there, and never returned to the U.S. He lived to be 100 years old. He was buried in the U.S. Army cemetery in Paris, France." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.  

Additional information about Jane Kennedy will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
