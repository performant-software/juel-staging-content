<p>"1908 and 1913 Clan Barbecue," two photographs including African Americans by Rufus W. Holsinger, taken on on June 19, 1913.</p><p>The photographs are not duplicates but clearly were taken one after the other in quick succession. Not much about the portrait is known; however, of interest is the presence of the two older African American men (one seated front and center, the other seated about two rows back on the far left.) It appears that the gentleman on the far left of the photograph is <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/366" target="_blank" title="Martin, Henry">Henry Martin</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=46982" target="_blank" title="P46982">P46982</a>). The second gentleman may also be an employee of the University of Virginia, or in some way affiliated with it (as was Henry Martin).</p><p>The portrait was from a barbecue and commencement event for the 1913 graduating class (dressed in Sailor's scarves as part of festivities) (Jane Smith).&nbsp;</p><p>These two photographs are included here in that, although not posed portraits of African Americans, they show actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play. They are highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment.</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).&nbsp;</em></p><p>Below: X01469B1<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1041239/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="1908 and 1913 Clan Barbecue" title="1908 and 1913 Clan Barbecue" width="778" height="561" /></p><p>Below: X01469B<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1041238/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="1908 and 1913 Clan Barbecue" title="1908 and 1913 Clan Barbecue" width="778" height="561" /><br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://v3.lib.virginia.edu/sources/images/items/uva-lib:1041239" target="_blank" title="1908 and 1913 Clan Barbecue">1908 and 1913 Clan Barbecue</a>," 1913-06-19 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X01469B1)</span><span class="text_exposed_show">&nbsp;</span></p><p>- "<a href="https://v3.lib.virginia.edu/sources/images/items/uva-lib:1041238" target="_blank" title="1908 and 1913 Clan Barbecue">1908 and 1913 Clan Barbecue</a>," 1913-06-19 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X01469B)</p><p>- Information regarding the 1913 commencement/barbecue courtesy of Ms. Jane Smith&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
