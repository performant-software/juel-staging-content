"Hazel Flannagan," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on March 18, 1919.

From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"This is my aunt. I'm Melvin Flannagan Jr. This photo was taken at the Queen Charlotte Hotel in 1919." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day. 

Note that this portrait shows the young woman dressed in what looks like nurse's clothing. It was not uncommon in this time period to choose to depict oneself in one's work clothing and with accessories/tools of the trade when sitting for a photo, known as "occupational portraits" (Finefield) (for an example, see  [James Lightfoot](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1206 "Lightfoot, James")). Whether purposefully showcasing her occupation or not (choosing to be photographed "as is"), it is an interesting act of self-representation. 

Additional information about Hazel Flannagan, Melvin Flannagan Jr., and family will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Flanagan, Hazel](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1050747/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Flannagan, Hazel")
