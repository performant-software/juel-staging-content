"Robert Jackson," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 21, 1918.

There are three Robert Jacksons listed in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home database, which may or may not be the same person as the individual photographed below. One was born 1914 (not applicable). The other two listings are as follows. "Jackson, Robert born October 18, 1895 in Charlottesville VA to parents George Jackson and Priscilla Barber; died May 11, 1930 at 1007 Page Street, Charlottesville VA; spouse Bessie Jackson previously deceased; buried at Oakwood Cemetery." The second listing is: "Jackson, Robert born August 6, 1898 in Albemarle County Virginia; died July 19 1978 in Albemarle County Virginia and buried in Oakwood Cemetery." 

A Robert Jackson is listed in the Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15; it may or may not be the same person as photographed by Holsinger: "Jackson Robert, porter h\[ome\] 8th N W n\[ea\]r Porter" (p.110). 

Additional information about Robert Jackson will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Jackson, Robert](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049907/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Jackson, Robert")
