<p>"New Bank Building / Acme Shaving Parlor," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on September 24, 1914.&nbsp;</p><p>The photograph shows two African Americans (who appear to be posing for the photo, by standing still and in front of the building); no identifying information is known, aside from the title by which the photograph is labelled in the Holsinger ledgers. The library catalogue describes the building as being on Main St.<br /><br />Of particular interest is the building signage which reads, "Acme Shaving Parlor" (where the gentleman in the hat is standing). A sign in the window also says Acme, and is next to a barber's pole. To the right of him is the bare-headed gentleman, who is standing before signage that can be partially read: "Zimm...Druggists." The Charlottesville City Directory of 1914-15 provides details for these signs.&nbsp;The druggist shop would have been "Zimmerman-Link Co. Inc., Druggists" at 121 East Main (p. 210). At the corner is a sign for Billiards; this was likely the Billiards parlor at 123 East Main (owned by S. L. Leterman) (p.124).</p><p>Acme Shaving Parlor was run by two African American men, Oscar G. Conn and L.W. Robinson (p.33). Their full names were&nbsp;Oscar G. Conn (home Dice Street) and Lafayette W. Anderson (home 278 West Main) (pp. 67, 159). <br /><br />The portrait by Holsinger photograph is especially important in showing one of several businesses run by African Americans in this time period. The images, along with the City Directories, tell us the location of the businesses, where the proprietors lived, their potential customers, the neighborhoods or business districts, and so on, helping us to better understand the actual lived environment of Charlottesville and surrounding counties in the Jim-Crow era.</p><p>Conn and Robinson regularly advertized in the&nbsp;<em>Daily Progress</em>, with their ad often appearing on the bottom right of third page (for example, below, from the November 29, 1918 issue). The ad reads, "Thoroughly sanitary, Handsomely furnished, Big electric fan, five chairs, Very latest equipment in electric massage and hair dryers, Hand massage by experts a Specialty, Prompt services Polite attention." (In 1917 issues, the ad still appears on the third page, with the same text.)&nbsp;<br /><br />Daily Progress, November 29, 1918 Ad (p.3)<br /><img src="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/media/images/Screenshot%202022-03-21%20at%201.41.41%20PM.png" alt="Acme Shaving Parlor Ad" title="Acme Shaving Parlor Ad" width="502" height="436" /></p><p>Other businesses/owners photographed by Holsinger include <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/2164" target="_blank" title="Acme Shaving Parlor Ad">Acme Shaving Parlor</a>, <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1186" target="_blank" title="William F. and Charles H.
