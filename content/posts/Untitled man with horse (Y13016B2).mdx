<p>Untitled (portrait of a man with a horse), a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger's son, Ralph W. Holsinger, date unknown.</p><p>Photographs were labelled in Holsinger's ledgers by the name of the person whom paid for the portrait; in this instance, no name is associated (perhaps an error in transcribing Holsinger's written ledgers, or, perhaps the writing was illegible for that entry).&nbsp;The date is also not known, again, likely due to an error in legibility or transcription.</p><p>The identity of, and additional information about, the man will be added as it is researched.</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</em></p><p>Below: Y13016B2<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1051276/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="untitled " title="untitled" width="778" height="561" /><br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p>- "<a href="https://v3.lib.virginia.edu/sources/images/items/uva-lib:1051276" target="_blank" title="Untitled ">Untitled</a>," no date (~1920/1939) photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (Y13016B2)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
