"Lee Davenport," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on December 29, 1913.

Holsinger made a print of a prior photograph, which (as can be seen in the details of the jacket below) appears to combine illustration with a photograph. 

The below death certificate may be about the same Lee Davenport photographed; more informaiton is needed, however, to confirm if this if regarding the same gentleman.

Additional information about Lee Davenport will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
