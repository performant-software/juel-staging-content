Sally Cottrell Cole, adult female, born a slave at Monticello. Unlike many African-American individuals involved at the University in this early period, she is an individual about which relatively many details are known. Born around 1800, Sally worked as a maid for Jefferson's granddaughter, Ellen Randolph ([P47546](/en/people/94c4a4bb-9228-482f-a51c-26ed6969096c "P47546")). She was hired out to the wife of Professor Thomas Hewitt Key ([P43622](/en/people/b7fa609b-5853-481a-9f78-3935d33596f3 "P43622")) (the University's first professor of Mathematics) from 1825 to 1827, at which point she was purchased (for $400) by Key before his return to his native England. His condition of purchase was for her to be immediately freed. Virginia law at the time required freed persons to leave the State within 12 months of manumission ("Unearthing Slavery at the University of Virginia").

No doubt a difficult choice, Sally instead chose to stay in the Charlottesville area, first working for Professor John P. Emmet ([P43625](/en/people/380c50b5-e3c1-4a87-a607-83dac3879ba0 "P43625")) then on her own as a seamstress. Other details known about her include that she was baptized at the First Baptist Church in 1841, and married Reuben Cole, a freed black man, in 1846.
