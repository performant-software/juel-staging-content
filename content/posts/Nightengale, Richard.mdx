Holsinger taken on August 01, 1915.</p><p><br />The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database has several entries about a Richard Nightengale, but it is unclear if they are the same person as the Richard Nightengale who paid for the portrait (or, if related to the woman pictured below).</p><p></p><p>The 1910 Charlottesville Census has an entry about a Richard Nightengale; it may or may not be about the same individual as photographed/paid for the photograph below: ¨Nightengale, Richard W., male, 22, mulatto, born in Virginia; Married for one year; occupation: Blacksmith shop - owner of own shop; can read and write; residing in Scottsville area; dwelling number 15, on N/S Road to Keene." The 1910 Census results show that a large number of Nightengales, all listed as mulatto, were residing in the area at that time. More information is needed to verify the identity of Richard Nightengale/the woman photographed.</p><p><br />Since the end of the Civil War through to the the period of Holsinger's portraits (and beyond), the area around Scottsville, in Albemarle County, Virginia had a significant African American population (with a community west of Scottsville known as Esmont / Potterś Precinct. The Scottsville Museum has a great deal of information on Esmont <a href="https://scottsvillemuseum.com/esmont/home.html" target="_blank" title="Esmont">here</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Additional information about Richard Nightengale / the subject photographed will be added as it is researched.<br /><br /></p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</em></p><p><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1043482/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg" alt="Nightengale, Richard" title="Nightengale, Richard" width="1000" height="1337" />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p>- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1043482#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=-1412%2C-202%2C5618%2C4165" target="_blank" title="Nightengale, Richard">Richard Nightengale</a>," 1915-08-01 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X03389A)&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p>- <a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/census/search_popcensus.cgi?search_type=individ&amp;id=8814&amp;year=1910&amp;community=%" target="_blank" title="Nightengale, Richard">Richard Nightengale entry, 1910 Census</a>&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p>- <a href="https://scottsvillemuseum.com/esmont/home.html" target="_blank" title="Esmont, Scottsville Museum">History of Esmont, Scottsville Museum</a></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
