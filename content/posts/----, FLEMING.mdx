Fleming, male (last name unknown), sometimes called "boy Fleming." Mentioned throughout the Proctor's Daybook in entries for 1822 and 1823, he was hired out to the university by Joseph Brand ([P46991](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=46991 "P46991")) in accompaniment with [Sukey](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/425 "Sukey"). For instance, a memorandum of hires made for 1822 lists, "Boy Fleming and Woman Sukey of Jo Brand - Bond given 65 a blanket with each."
