Fleming, male (last name unknown), sometimes called "boy Fleming." Mentioned throughout the Proctor's Daybook in entries for 1822 and 1823, he was hired out to the university by Joseph Brand ([P46991](/en/people/71b9968f-3625-4974-a92d-bea950841534 "P46991")) in accompaniment with [Sukey](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/425 "Sukey"). For instance, a memorandum of hires made for 1822 lists, "Boy Fleming and Woman Sukey of Jo Brand - Bond given 65 a blanket with each."
