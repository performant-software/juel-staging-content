"Mary Woodfolk," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 31, 1914.  
  
The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database has three entries for African American women named Mary Woodfolk; one entry may relate to the woman photographed below: ¨Woodfolk, Mary; born August 11, 1883 in Charlottesville Virginia to parents John Truehart and Sally Kimbo; spouse Ollie T. Woodfolk; sons Theodore and Ollie Woodfolk; daughters Annie Actie, Marion Woodfolk, and Lucille Jones; died July 20, 1978; place of death 779 Raymond Road Charlottesville Virginia; buried at Lincoln Cemetery.¨ The apparent age of the woman photographed below does seem to match that of the entry (approximately 31 in 1914); more information is needed to verify if the entry is about the woman in the portrait.

The gravestone for Mary M. Woodfolk at [Lincoln Cemetery](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/db/cemetery/details/LNC/ "Lincoln Cemetery") (owned by J. F. Bell Funeral Home, in Albemarle County, Virginia) can be seen [here](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/db/person/details/LNC:8/ "Mary M. Woodfolk").  
  
Additional information about Mary Woodfolk will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Woodfolk, Mary](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042364/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Woodfolk, Mary")
