Peter, adult male, photographed by Rufus W. Holsinger. Note that the portrait is labelled, "Uncle Peter," but it may be of the well-known local nicknamed "Uncle Peter" (Peter Briggs) who worked at UVA (or, servant Peter Fossett).

This portrait appears to have been taken before the Weaver's Cottage at Monticello.

Additional information about Peter will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._ !["Uncle Peter"](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1039585/full/778,561/0/default.jpg ""Uncle Peter"")
