"Charlottesville Canning Factory," nine photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on November 2, 1916. 

The two photographs below show African Americans; no identifying information is known, aside from the title by which the photographs were labelled in the Holsinger ledgers. The nine photographs appear to be in a sequence; the two included below show African Americans amongst the other workers.  
  
The photographs are included here in that, although not posed studio portraits of African Americans, they show actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play. It is highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment.  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
