"Henry Cooper," three photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on November 26, 1917.

One photograph (ID X05763A2) is missing from the UVA Library Catalogue, but is described as showing the same subject (it is unknown whether the man or woman, or both, are in this third image).

Additional information about Henry Cooper will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
