<p>In the spring semester of 2016, Professor Andrew Johnston led a course, <a href="http://www.arch.virginia.edu/projects/node/2342">ARCH 5610 - Field Methods II: Representing Historic Buildings</a>.</p>
<p>In this course, three teams of students (graduate and undergraduate) defined a <a href="http://fieldmethods.iath.virginia.edu/16SpARH5610/">transect of the Lawn</a> that joined Pavilion I with <a href="http://fieldmethods.iath.virginia.edu/16SpARH5610/hotel_a/">Hotel A</a> and the <a href="http://fieldmethods.iath.virginia.edu/16SpARH5610/anatomical_theatre/">Anatomical Theatre</a> on the west with the <a href="http://fieldmethods.iath.virginia.edu/16SpARH5610/pavilion_iv_garden">garden of Pavilion IV</a> on the east. Each team investigated the activities of the University community as documented in those three areas.</p>
