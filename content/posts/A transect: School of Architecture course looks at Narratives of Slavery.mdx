In the spring semester of 2016, Professor Andrew Johnston led a course, [ARCH 5610 - Field Methods II: Representing Historic Buildings](http://www.arch.virginia.edu/projects/node/2342).

In this course, three teams of students (graduate and undergraduate) defined a [transect of the Lawn](http://fieldmethods.iath.virginia.edu/16SpARH5610/) that joined Pavilion I with [Hotel A](http://fieldmethods.iath.virginia.edu/16SpARH5610/hotel_a/) and the [Anatomical Theatre](http://fieldmethods.iath.virginia.edu/16SpARH5610/anatomical_theatre/) on the west with the [garden of Pavilion IV](http://fieldmethods.iath.virginia.edu/16SpARH5610/pavilion_iv_garden) on the east. Each team investigated the activities of the University community as documented in those three areas.
