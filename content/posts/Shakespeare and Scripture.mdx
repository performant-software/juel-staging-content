<p dir="ltr"><span>Students of the University frequently turned to literature when signing the autograph books of their classmates. While there was an Alexander Pope or John Milton quotation here and there, the two most common sources of inspiration were William Shakespeare and the Book of Proverbs. Sometimes misquoted or taken out of context, these quotations are still an interesting glimpse into the common wisdom of the time.</span></p>
