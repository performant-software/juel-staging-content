"Teacher Training Class Baptist," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on May 26, 1918.

Interestingly, the photograph captures the unidentified African American man standing at the window of the building.

A similar portrait that appears to have captured persons in the background by chance is "[Golden Wedding](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1923 "Teacher Training Class Baptist")."

Additional information about the African American individual photographed will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Teacher Training Class Baptist](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049211/full/1000,819/0/default.jpg "Teacher Training Class Baptist")
