<p>"Mew Morbie's Group and Banquet," two photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on September 23, 1914 and September 24, 1914.</p><p>The first photograph (X02623B) shows men and women at a function, with an African American server standing in the center background. Note the confederate flag decorations throughout the hall.</p><p>The second photograph (X02623C) does not show any African Americans, but is also labelled "Mew Morbie's Group and Banquet" (and dated the day after, September 24).&nbsp;</p><p>This photograph is included here in that, although not a posed studio portrait of African Americans, it does show actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play or, in this instance, show African Americans in their own domain (whether before their home, in social groups, etc.).&nbsp;It is highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment.</p><p>More details will be added as they are found.</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).&nbsp;</em></p><p>Below: X02623B<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042540/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Mew Morbie's Group and Banquet" title="Mew Morbie's Group and Banquet" width="778" height="561" /></p><p>Below: X02623C<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042541/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Mew Morbie's Group and Banquet" title="Mew Morbie's Group and Banquet" width="778" height="561" /><br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;"<a href="https://v3.lib.virginia.edu/sources/images/items/uva-lib:1042540" title="New Morbie's Group and Banquet">Mew Morbie's Group and Banquet</a>,"&nbsp;1914-09-23, photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X02623B)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br />-&nbsp;"<a href="https://v3.lib.virginia.edu/sources/images/items/uva-lib:1042541" title="Mew Morbie's Group and Banquet">Mew Morbie's Group and Banquet</a>,"&nbsp;1914-09-24, photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X02623C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
