title: Race in the Election of 1860
---
The use of racial slurs, slander, and insults in the political realm are all too familiar to United States politics where things grow toxic quickly and intensely. One striking example of this rhetoric came during the election of Abraham Lincoln, whose presidency would eventually provide a path to the abolishment of slavery through the 13th Amendment, as well as Civil War fought over the moral, economic, and political issue that was the enslavement of Africans by Americans.

The opposition to Lincoln in 1860 were frank in their perception and portrayal of Lincoln as a candidate: a “radical abolitionist” that supposedly supported the immediate abolition and emancipation of enslaved laborers in all US states and territories, suffrage for black people and equal rights among other freedoms. In reality, the label of Lincoln as a “black president” reflects a politically-motivated narrative that did not even trivially represent in any way his thoughts about slavery and black oppression.

What’s the gain in trying to label a presidential candidate in this way for political support? The economic “disadvantage” of abolition to Southern farmers and businessmen fueled their efforts to stop Lincoln’s election. Moreover, the threat that the longstanding racial and social "order" would collapse the moment Lincoln became president, putting blacks on the same social standing as whites, triggered this fierce opposition. The term “black president” was meant to scare these Southern voters into voting against Lincoln purely out of a fear that, if he became Commander in Chief, he would completely tear down the racial barriers established so firmly in America’s economy and society.

Was this legitimate? Despite the terrible rhetoric which weaponized racial identity as a political tool, was Lincoln truly as “threatening” to the racial order set up by slavery in the United States? No. Lincoln was a moderate on these issues. In fact, Lincoln never identified as an abolitionist. He supported the idea of stopping the slave trade from expanding into the western States, but never explicitly vouched for black civil rights, suffrage, nor even an immediate abolition of the slave trade in the nation. Being from the Midwest, Lincoln ran a campaign that set its sights on the western, free white laborer’s rights, whose wages were beginning to depress because of the slave trade. This became known as the “Free Soil, Free Labor” movement. This was the vision for Lincoln and slavery when he ran for president. Lincoln also had interests in the movement of slaves away from the US mainland to outside colonies and territories, but never expressed a desire for equality between black and white people.

The use of “black president” for Lincoln’s election generated in 1860 from a paper by James P. Holcombe, a well-known Virginian lawyer and professor who argued heavily in favor of slavery and states’ rights. He directed much of his rhetoric in the 1860 cycle at what he called a “black Republican party,” referring again to the idea that the Republican candidate would attempt to completely abolish slavery and establish civil equality between blacks and whites. Holcombe also saw a war over slavery in the distance when writing his pamphlet titled “The Election of a Black Republican President”: “…between the free labor of the North, and the slave labor of the South an irrepressible conflict must take place until one gives way to the other.” He accused the Republican Party of bringing racial equality into the political mix even though Lincoln, as mentioned earlier, was not thinking of slowing down the slave trade slavery as some engine to achieve societal parity. Holcombe’s language, though, worked to set the stage of the 1860 race as one that pitted “radical, abolitionist” Republicans against the “honor and tradition” of the Democratic South. The pamphlet even includes the title “Overt Act of Aggression” in reference to the party electing Lincoln as some catastrophe, the “black President.”

Many of the misconceptions, slanders, and political jabs thrown at Lincoln over his intentions around slavery and race can still be seen today. The political cycle has a long, ever-evolving history with race and, since before Lincoln, both parties have launched their own campaign offensives which weaponize race and race relations to stoke fear among their bases and discredit opposing candidates by falsely representing candidates’ views on the topic. While the election of 1860 and its context in abolishing a once legal slave trade revealed more explicitly the use of race as a political weapon, these same themes and ideas appear ever so present today when looking to gain an edge through the portrayal of opponents as “anti-American” in regards to racial equality.
