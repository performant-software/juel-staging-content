Isham, male, is mentioned several times in the Proctor's Daybook for 1822. Owned by Edmund Bacon ([P46990](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=46990 "P46990")), he was frequently hired out to the university along with [John](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/422 "John"), [Lewis](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/423 "Lewis"), and [Wilson](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/424 "Wilson"). Throughout the book, the amount of 70.00$ per hire per year seems consistent, as per this September 25, 1822 entry: "To Ed Bacon for hire of Isham, Lewis, John and Wilson at 70 each."
