Holsinger was involved in the sale of four properties on Page Street, Charlottesville, from the years 1902-1928 (source: City of Charlottesville). This street was known (particularly in the early 20's and onward, as seen in rental/sale records) for housing that was rented to working-class African Americans.  
  
1) **1006 Page Street**. The house was constructed in 1927. The property was sold by Holsinger on January 29, 1928 to Thomas and Mattie Bridgeford. "Sorie Flood lived in the house from 1927 until 1934 with her first husband Arthur Flood, an African American auto mechanic" (City of Charlottesville). \[Mattie Bridgeford, African-American, living at 201 Oak Street, listed at Charlottesville City Directory 1914-15\]

2) **1056 Page Street**. The house was onstructed around 1929. R. C. A. Seiburg sold the property to Holsinger on May 10, 1902; George Gilmer bought it in 1927; Marie Roberson bought the land in 1927; she married Samuel Woodfork/Woodfolk and they jointly owned the property until 1966. "Marie Roberson first rented the house to another African American woman during the late 1920s, Janie Day, a domestic servant."

3) **1058 Page Street**. The house was constructed in 1927. Holsinger sold the property to George Gilmer on March 2, 1927; Thomas and Mattie Bridgeford bought the property in 1927. "It was originally a rental property for the Bridgeford family. They rented to two African American families: Clarence Stewart, a brick worker and his wife Willie Stewart, a domestic servant (1927 – 1931) and John Blair, an icemaker and his wife Ella Blair (1931 – 1937). From 1940 until his death in 1968, Howard S. Magruder, a lab aide at UVA lived in the house with his wife Lucy B. Magruder and their family (they rented the house from 1940 – 1948 before purchasing)" (City of Charlottesville).  
  
4) **1100 Page Street**. The house was constructed in 1922. Holsinger sold the property to Robert B. Bell on April 9, 1919: "Robert B. Bell, an African American janitor and his wife Beatrice Bell lived at the house from 1922 until 1934. The house was rented to David Mason, an African American porter at VA Stage Lines, his wife Nannie Mason and their son David Mason Jr., a laborer from 1934-45. David passed away and Nannie Mason continued to live at the house with David Jr. through the 1950s and 1960s, working as maid at Ferguson's Funeral Home" (City of Charlottesville). \[David Mason listed in the Charlottesville City Directory 1914-15 as "driver J H Montague & Co h 212 Digges" (p133)\]

5) NEW **906-910 West Main St**. The VIRGO catalogue lists a building at 906-910 West Main Street as being Holsinger's studio, built 1934. This information has to be verified.
