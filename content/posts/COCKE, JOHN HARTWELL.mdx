He was a long-standing member of the Board of Visitors, serving from 1825 to 1851, and aided in the construction of the University in the 1820s. Documents from 1825 show his purchasing land near the university: a deed dated 8 March 1825 notes his purchase of property from the freed person of colour, <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/717" title="Robert Battles">Robert Battles</a> (P47363), and, later, his interest in property owned by the freedman <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/718" title="Stephen Coram">Stephen Coram</a> (P47365).&nbsp;A later entry in the Faculty Minutes (session 13), 1837, mentions his owning a house (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=9353" title="PL9353">PL9353</a>)&nbsp;in the vicinity of the university (on a road from Charlottesville), in which resided a "colored woman," <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/840" title="ANON0057">ANON0057</a> (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47880" title="P47880">P47880</a>) who reported disorderly conduct by a group of students who broke panes of glass (see full account&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/840" title="ANON0057">here</a>).</p><p>Cocke was also involved in the sale and capture of slaves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PRIMARY SOURCE INFORMATION</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1.
