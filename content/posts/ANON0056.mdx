**JUEL ID/KEY: [P47810](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47810 "P47810")**

Anon0056 (last name unknown), adult male. He is a servant of Dr. Hamner ([P43771](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43771 "P43771")), mentioned in the Chairman's Journals entry for April 10, 1861:

"Dr. Hamner reported Mr. Buford ([P34704](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=34704 "P34704")) (one of his boarders) for striking his servant ([P47810](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47810#m1 "P47810")). Mr. Buford was sent for, reprimanded for the offence and warned against its repetition."

There is no subsequent information given of this situation in the journal. From 1838 to 1861, Dr. Hamner was the manager of Hotel F ([PL8437](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8437 "PL8437")). Likely at the time of this incident, however, Hamner may have been manager of his own boarding house ([PL9330](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=9330 "PL9330")), based on how he is described. Consider for instance the wording of the next entry in the Chairman's Journal, dated April 13th: "At Dr. Hamner[](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_P43771)'s request, gave \[a student\] leave to withdraw from his boarding house."
