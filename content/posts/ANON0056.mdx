<p><strong>JUEL ID/KEY:&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47810" title="P47810">P47810</a></strong></p><p>Anon0056 (last name unknown), adult male. He is a servant of Dr. Hamner (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43771" target="new" title="P43771">P43771</a>),&nbsp;mentioned in the Chairman's Journals entry for April 10, 1861:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"<span>Dr. Hamner&nbsp;</span><span>reported&nbsp;</span><span>Mr. Buford (<span><a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=34704" target="new" title="P34704">P34704</a>)</span></span><span>&nbsp;(one of his boarders) for striking his&nbsp;</span><span>servant (<span><a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47810#m1" target="new" title="P47810">P47810</a>).</span></span><span>&nbsp;Mr. Buford was sent for, reprimanded for the offence and warned against its repetition.</span>"</p><p>There is no subsequent information given of this situation in the journal. From 1838 to 1861, Dr. Hamner was the manager of Hotel F (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8437" title="PL8437">PL8437</a>). Likely at the time of this incident, however, Hamner may have been manager of his own boarding house (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=9330" title="PL9330">PL9330</a>), based on how he is described. Consider for instance the wording of the next entry in the Chairman's Journal, dated April 13th: "<span>At&nbsp;</span><span>Dr. Hamner<span><a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_P43771" target="new"></a></span></span><span>'s request, gave [a student]</span><span>&nbsp;leave to withdraw from his boarding house."</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PRIMARY SOURCE INFORMATION</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1.
