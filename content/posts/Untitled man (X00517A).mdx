Untitled (portrait of a man), a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on September 9, 1912.

Photographs were labelled in Holsinger's ledgers by the name of the person whom paid for the portrait; in this instance, no name is associated (perhaps an error in transcribing Holsinger's written ledgers, or, perhaps the writing was illegible for that entry). 

The identity of, and additional information about, the young man will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![seated man](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1040312/full/full/0/default.jpg "seated man")
