The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database has an entry that may be about the woman photographed below: "Clara Annabelle Toms; born July 10 1901 in Rockfish, Virginia to parents Frank Walker and Carrie Wayne; spouse Tinsley Lee Toms; died November 5 1969 at UVA Hospital; buried at Trinity Episcopal Church Cemetery in Elmington Virginia; sons Alfred Toms, Bronx, NY; Frank Toms, Newark, NJ; Edwin Toms, Toledo, OH; Lorenzo Toms, Charlottesville, VA; daughter Lucille Davis, Millsboro, Del." More information is needed to determine if this information applies to the subject below.

Additional information about Clara Walker will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Walker, Clara](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049754/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Walker, Clara")
