Armistead (last name unknown), adult male. His spouse [Milly](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/801 "----, MILLY") ([P47775](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47775 "P47775")) was a slave of Board of Visitors member and Rector (1864-5) Thomas Lewis Preston ([P43698](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43698 "P43698")); his son was [Humphrey](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1972 "----, HUMPHREY") ([P49029](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=49029 "P49029")).

So far, the only reference to Armistead is in an 1865 letter; however, more information is known about Milly, from the below letter and from information about her being buried at the University of Virginia Cemetery ([PL8510](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8510 "PL8510")).  
  
The letter, "\[?\] To Aunt \[?\] March 8, 1865" briefly mentions Milly, Humphrey, and Armistead. The letter details the Union Army’s occupation of Charlottesville, written by one of John B. Minor's ([P22874](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=22874 "P22874")) daughters (which one is to be determined) to an Aunt (which one also to be determined). The letter mentions several servants/ slaves, including "Milly's son":

>   
> At Edgehill ([PL8939](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8939 "PL8939")) they \[the Yankees\] carried off the horses, some provisions & servants, & forced cousin Mary to give them the rings on her finger. All the horses from Little Run are gone & two of the men. Armistead & Milly's son - Humphrey was taken but begged so hard to be allowed to come back to his "old miss" that they agreed & he arrived today. Henry was taken too & camped \[before?\] Carr's Hill ([PL8512](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8512 "PL8512")) with the officers. He has arrived since.  
>   

The letter also mentions a servant named Rachel and the servant Berkley ([P49030](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=49030 "P49030")), who is identified in the letter as the slave of Dr. Maupin ([P43731](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43731 "Maupin, Dr. Socrates")).

More information about Armistead will be added as it is discovered.
