Armistead (last name unknown), adult male. His spouse [Milly](/en/people/08781cd2-631b-4790-91f8-d58e6354c2c0 "----, MILLY") ([P47775](/en/people/08781cd2-631b-4790-91f8-d58e6354c2c0 "P47775")) was a slave of Board of Visitors member and Rector (1864-5) Thomas Lewis Preston ([P43698](/en/people/36b89684-f4fa-45bc-b1b6-08e89dcaee44 "P43698")); his son was [Humphrey](/en/people/8637385a-77c0-4b70-81a7-2ff7fcdf5132 "----, HUMPHREY") ([P49029](/en/people/8637385a-77c0-4b70-81a7-2ff7fcdf5132 "P49029")).

So far, the only reference to Armistead is in an 1865 letter; however, more information is known about Milly, from the below letter and from information about her being buried at the University of Virginia Cemetery ([PL8510](/en/places/ee42cc6c-76a7-4626-95a3-4e0559e8153c "PL8510")).  
  
The letter, "\[?\] To Aunt \[?\] March 8, 1865" briefly mentions Milly, Humphrey, and Armistead. The letter details the Union Army’s occupation of Charlottesville, written by one of John B. Minor's ([P22874](/en/people/f624eefa-050a-46a9-a735-298a6fe3ce23 "P22874")) daughters (which one is to be determined) to an Aunt (which one also to be determined). The letter mentions several servants/ slaves, including "Milly's son":

>   
> At Edgehill ([PL8939](/en/places/31a1574c-4da3-4567-906a-86e6da1da6d6 "PL8939")) they \[the Yankees\] carried off the horses, some provisions & servants, & forced cousin Mary to give them the rings on her finger. All the horses from Little Run are gone & two of the men. Armistead & Milly's son - Humphrey was taken but begged so hard to be allowed to come back to his "old miss" that they agreed & he arrived today. Henry was taken too & camped \[before?\] Carr's Hill ([PL8512](/en/places/7daaca94-65b7-4a9e-8b12-fb16d8e99fc1 "PL8512")) with the officers. He has arrived since.

The letter also mentions a servant named Rachel and the servant Berkley ([P49030](/en/people/a125b21c-887c-4693-8c1b-14a926bfcae3 "P49030")), who is identified in the letter as the slave of Dr. Maupin ([P43731](/en/people/fc75bf66-fd65-4729-b33f-61e4e01c1b7e "Maupin, Dr. Socrates")).

More information about Armistead will be added as it is discovered.
