"Waddell Brown," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on November 1, 1917.   
  

A Waddell Brown is listed in the Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15; it may or may not be the same person as in this photograph: "Brown Waddell, orderly University Hospital" (p.52). Many African Americans did work at the University of Virginia hospital in this time period. 

Additional information about Waddell Brown will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
