<p>Wilson (last name unknown), adult male, is mentioned several times in the Proctor's Daybook for 1822. Owned by Edmund Bacon&nbsp;(<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=46990" title="P46990">P46990</a>), he was frequently hired out to the university along with&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/419" title="Isham">Isham</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/422" title="John">John</a>, and <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/423" title="Lewis">Lewis</a>. Throughout the book, the amount of 70.00$ per hire per year seems consistent, as per this September 25, 1822 entry: "To Ed Bacon for hire of Isham, Lewis, John and Wilson at 70 each."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
