"Mary Wood," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on September 15, 1915.

The young girl looks similar to the girls in the portrait of the [unidentified family](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1295 "Unidentified Family"); it is not entirely clear whether it is the same family (more information is needed to determine if there is any relation/the identities).

Additional information about Mary Wood will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Mary Wood](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1043620/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Mary Wood")
