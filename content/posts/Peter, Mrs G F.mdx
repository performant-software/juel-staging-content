"Mrs. G. F. Peter," ten photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 19, 1918.

Of the ten photographs: one is of a young girl, outdoors, in front of a house (presumably, a daughter of Mrs. G. F. Peter); four are of a woman (presumably, Mrs. G. F. Peter) seated on a horse; and five are "portraits" of horses with an African-American man holding the reigns (presumably, he is the employee of Mrs. G. F. Peter). 

These types of photographs (catalouging and displaying the owner's horses/possessions) have a long visual history; it is not uncommon for the stablehands/employees to be pictured alongside the horses, as seen in these portraits. Below are the five photographs showing the African American individual. His identity as yet is not known. 

Additional information about Mrs. G. F. Peter / the African American man photographed will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
