Old Sam (last name unknown), adult male. 

Arthur Spice Brockenbrough (A.S.B.) ([P43627](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43627 "P43627")) was Proctor of the University of Virginia from 1819 to 1831. In this position, particularly during the years of the academical village's construction, he was frequently part of early transactions in hiring slaves, as detailed in his own records in the Proctor's Daybook. Most of the transactions detail his hiring slaves on behalf of the university, while some record payments to overseers involved in procuring slaves for labor. Numerous entries were recorded in his Daybook from 1822 through 1827, involving the slaves [Aaron](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/688 "Aaron") (1826-7), [Davey](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/684 "Davey") (1823, 1825-7), [Dick](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/690 "Dick") (1827), "hands" ([CB0931](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=931 "BROCKENBROUGH'S HANDS")) (1825), "[Harry of A.
