"Willis Hansvery," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on July 03, 1916.

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database has an entry that may be about the older subject photographed below (the approximate age and similar name, with variant in spelling, matches the subject): "Willis Hansberry Johnson, born January 16 1868 in Rockfish Virginia; parent Jacob Johnson; died December 31, 1941 in Rockfish Virginia; buried in Faber Virginia; spouse Cammie."

Additional information about Willis Hansvery will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Hansvery, Willis](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1044289/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Hansvery, Willis")
