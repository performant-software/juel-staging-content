"Hattie Johnson," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 8, 1918.

From "Gone But Not Forgotten" Exhibit opening night, 2 August 2019: 

"I believe this is Lucille Johnson, daughter of Hattie Tyree Johnson and William Johnson of Stony Point. My Great Aunt - Sister to Alicia Johnson Solomon, William Johnson, Preston Johnson & George Johnson." - Shirley Solomon Parrish, attendee. \***Note**: the image is labelled "Hattie Johnson" in the Holsinger catalogue, and so can't be found if searching by the name "Lucille Johnson" (instead, search by the ID X06562A).

In addition to the portrait labelled Hattie Johnson (X06562A), there is an additional portrait of two women (X06491A2), one of whom is likely Hattie Johnson, taken on July 20, 1918. This photograph is untitled, meaning, that it was not labelled by any name in the Holsinger ledgers. The identity of the other woman is not yet known. (Possibly, as well, there is a similarity between Hattie Johnson and a woman in the group portrait, [J. P. Hawkins](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1307 "Hawkins, J. P.")). 

Additional information about Hattie Johnson will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
