"Luella Bray," three photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on June 9, 1911 and January 9, 1919. 

Two of the portraits (duplicates) are of a young girl (1911), and the third portrait of a woman (1919).

Information about a Luella Bray is recorded in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home database: "Louella Belle Bray," born June 3, 1880 to parents John and Lucinda (Adams) Bray; spouse Ralph; died June 27, 1949 and buried at Lincoln Cemetery; it is yet to be determined if this entrant is the same as the young girl or woman photographed in the below three portraits.

The tombstone for a ["Luella Bray"](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/db/person/details/LNC:298/ "Bray, Luella") (note the variation in spelling) is located in [Lincoln Cemetery](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/db/cemetery/details/LNC/ "Lincoln Cemetery") (owned by the J. F. Bell Funeral Home).

The Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 also lists an "Ella Bray" (note the variation in spelling): "Bray Ella, laundress h\[ome\] 104 10 1/2 N W" (p. 48). This may or may not be one of the individuals listed below; more information is needed.

  
Additional information about Luella Bray will be added as it is researched.  
  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
