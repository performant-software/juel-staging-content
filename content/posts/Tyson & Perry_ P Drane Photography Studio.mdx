One of the earliest photography studios in Charlottesville, Tyson & Perry's Studio produced images predating Holsinger's (based on the type of photographic material used). The studio appears to variously have been named "Tyson & Perry," "Perry & Drane," and "P. Drane Art Studio." The exact dates of operation, the name changes of the studio, addresses, and operators are not yet known. The 1902 records below do show that by 1902, their business had apparently been dissolved and Perry was working for Holsinger.

The 1902 Charlottesville City Directory does list a "Eugene A. Perry" as a photographer working at "R. Holsinger" and living at 415 1rst St. N. It also lists a "Chas. \[Charles\] Perry" working as a porter for Holsinger (p.97).

A photo labelled, "Tyson and Perry, Charlottesville, Virginia" (date unknown, between 1870-1878, by Heustis P. Cook) does show the exterior of the studio, with an external apparatus/structure that would allow for natural lighting (like a skylight). Sample photographs can also be seen at the studio entrance.
