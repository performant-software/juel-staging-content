"Lucy Blue," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 29, 1918.

From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"She was an elementary school teacher at Jefferson Elementary School. She taught 3rd grade." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day. 

"Related to Joseph Blue? Stony Point." - Ms. Shirley Parrish, 2 August 2019. 

It is not yet known whether she is related to [George Blue](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1441 "Blue, George") (also photographed by Holsinger, 1918). 

  
Additional information about Lucy Blue will be added as it is researched.  
  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
