"Texie Watts," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on November 28, 1917.

From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"This was my fourth-grade teacher's mother." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.  

Additional information about Texie Watts will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Watts, Texie](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1048932/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Watts, Texie")
