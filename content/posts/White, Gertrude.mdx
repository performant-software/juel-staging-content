"Miss Gertrude White," two photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on January 4, 1919.

The Charlottesville City Directory 1914-15 lists a Gertrude White; it may or may not be the same person as photographed by Holsinger (to be researched): "White Gertrude, h\[ome\] 403 E Water" (p.190).  
  
Lynn Rainville notes the unusual fact of Miss Gertrude White's casket being laid outside the home (normally, the viewing was held indoors). It was common at the time, however, for the body to be laid out at the home (in this instance, before Miss Gertrude White's home \[Rainville 89\].

Additional information about Gertrude White will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
