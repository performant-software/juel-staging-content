"Mattie Baker," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 27, 1914.

The 1910 Charlottesville and Esmont Census has an entry about a Mattie Baker; it may refer to the woman photographed below: ¨Baker, Mattie, 35, female, born in Virginia; married 20 years; cannot read or write; house number 215, Cox´s Row, Charlottesville Virginia.¨ The age of the person in the entry does seem to match with the apparant age of the subject photographed below; more information is needed, however, to verify if they are one and the same person. 

Additional information about Mattie Baker will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
