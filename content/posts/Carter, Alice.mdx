"Alice Carter," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on March 17, 1913.

  
The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database lists an Alice Carter: "Alice Carter \[birth date unknown\], Charlotte County Virginia; died March 31, 1954 in Keswick, Virginia and buried in Union Run Cemetery, about age 71." This entrant may or may not be the same woman as the one photographed below; further information is needed.

Additional information about Alice Carter will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._ ![Alice Carter](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1041019/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Alice Carter")
