Holsinger taken on April 7, 1914.</p><p>From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019:&nbsp;</p><p>"Before it was the Albemarle Hotel, it was the Gleason Hotel. He was the head bellman - he made $5 per week which was big money. It was his job to assign the different employees their jobs every day."&nbsp;- Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/104-0374_Hotel_Gleason_1983_NR_documentation.pdf" title="New Gleason Hotel">New Gleason Hotel</a>&nbsp;(referred to as "New Gleason," of "New Hotel Gleason" after renovations) was located at 619 West Main St. It is on the <a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/104-0374/" title="New Hotel Gleason">Virginia Historic Register</a>.</p><p>The 1914-15 Charlottesville City Directory lists a James Lightfoot living at "Ridge extd"&nbsp;(Ridge Street Extended), although it is not certain if this is the same person in question. It also lists a Joseph Lightfoot working as a "Bootblack" at 323 W Main in the same time period; he may or may not be related to James (to be determined).&nbsp;</p><p>The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database has an entry for an individual that may be related to the subject photographed below: "James Henry Lightfoot, born February 3, 1875 in Richmond Virginia to James and Minna (Carter) Lightfoot, spouse Mildred, died in Charlottesville and buried in Lincoln Cemetery." Given the age of the entrant in 1915 (39), he may be the parent of the individual photographed below.&nbsp;<br /><br />The tombstone for a <a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/db/person/details/LNC:338/" target="_blank" title="Lightfoot, James Henry ">James Henry Lightfoot</a>&nbsp;is located in <a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/db/cemetery/details/LNC/" target="_blank" title="Lincoln Cemetery">Lincoln Cemetery</a>, owned by J.

Bell Funeral Home.&nbsp;<br /><br />Additional information about James Lightfoot will be added as it is researched.</p><p><span style="font-size: small;"><i>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</i></span></p><p><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1041990/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg" alt="Lightfoot, James" title="Lightfoot, James" /></p><p>Some portraits by Holsinger show individuals in worker's clothing that do not indicate their job or trade (see, for example,&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1618" target="_blank" title="Brown, Bud">Bud Brown</a>), the sitters perhaps having come to get their portait taken in whatever clothing they were wearing at the time. Whether purposefully showcasing their occupation or not (choosing to be photographed "as is"), these are interesting acts of self-representation.&nbsp;It was not uncommon in this time period to choose to depict oneself in one's work clothing and with accessories/tools of the trade when sitting for a photo, known as "occupational portraits" (Finefield) - the one below, also by Holsinger, shows a railway worker (H.
