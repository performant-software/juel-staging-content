"Uncle Peter," adult male. (Peter Briggs).

A biographical article on Henry Martin, perhaps the most well-known of African American employees of the University of Virginia in the nineteenth century, mentions other employees who also worked in the capacity of janitors, mechanicians, and the like. The 1915 article quotes a passage in _College Topics_ that describes Martin as "one of the best type of the negro of the old South . . . \[with\] none of the buffoonery of that almost equally famous University character, **'Uncle Peter'**" (600). The quote reflects the stereotypical attitudes of the time period, _not_ the behaviour of  the actual individual.

More information about Uncle Peter will be added as it is researched. 

\*NOTE: a R. W. Holsinger portrait labelled, "Uncle Peter," is mislabelled and is **not** of the Uncle Peter (Peter Briggs) associated with the University (according to the UVA Library Catalogue).
