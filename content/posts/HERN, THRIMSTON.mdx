Thrimston Hern, the son of David and Isabel Hern, was enslaved by Thomas Jefferson at Monticello. He was a woodworker until 1820, when he was trained in stone cutting by John Gorman, who completed various masonry projects at Monticello and at the University.

In 1829 University proctor Arthur S. Brockenbrough bought Hern from Jefferson’s estate for $600 and proposed that he cut the stone for the steps of the Rotunda.

Life dates 1799-after 1831

His name is often misspelled, for he was mentioned in a March 30, 1831 Chairman's Journal entry: "Servants gambling. Servant, named [Thornton](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/395 "Thornton") ([P44757](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P44757 "P44757")), who was whipped for theft, and turned away from the University, last session, was found by the Janitor, playing cards with Mrs. Gray's ([P43865](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P43865 "P43865")) servant [Albert](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/397 "ALBERT") ([P46978](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P46978 "P46978")), and Mr. Brockenbrough’s ([P43627](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P43627 "P43627")) man Trimpson ([P47794](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P47794 "P47794")).
