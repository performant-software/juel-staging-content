<p>Guy, male, is mentioned twice in the Proctor's Daybook. "Boy Guy," as he is described in one entry, is owned by J. M. Perry (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47043" title="P47043">P47043</a>), who was paid 4.00$ per month for his being hired out to the university. On July 23 1824, an entry notes, "Sundries draft to Labour acct. J. M. Perry for hire Guy from 28 May at $4 p. month. to Sept next," at $16.00 total. On November 27, 1834, an entry notes, "J. M. Perry draft to Labour acct. for hire of boy Guy from 28th Sept. to 8 Nov. at $4/month, $5.34." Perry also hired a woman, <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/456" title="Maria">Maria</a>, to the university in the same time period.</p>
