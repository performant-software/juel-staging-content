Untitled (portrait of a young man), a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 18, 1914.

Photographs were labelled in Holsinger's ledgers by the name of the person whom paid for the portrait; in this instance, no name is associated (perhaps an error in transcribing Holsinger's written ledgers, or, perhaps the writing was illegible for that entry). 

Comments from Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"These are the O'Neal twins. I saw their picture on public television in the 1970's." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.  

The identity of, and additional information about, the young man will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Untitled young man (X02456A2)](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042303/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Untitled young man (X02456A2)")
