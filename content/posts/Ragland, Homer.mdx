"Homer Ragland," three photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on December 29, 1913 (two of the photos shown below; the digital copy of the third photo is temporarily unavailable via the UVA Library Catalogue). 

A Homer Ragland is listed in the Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15; it may  or may not be the same person as the subject photographed: "Ragland Homer, janitor h\[ome\] 303 West Main \[Street\]" (p. 155).

Several Raglands are listed in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home database; the following is listed about an Homer Ragland: "Homer Tonsler Ragland, born October 10 1872 in Keswick Virginia to mother Priscilla Ragland; spouse Emma; died January 5 1927 in Charlottesville Virginia and buried at 'Kelly's Lower End.'" 

Homer's mother, Priscilla Ragland, is confirmed to have been buried at the Daughters of Zion Cemetery, Charlottesville.

Additional information about Homer Ragland will be added as it is researched.

NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
