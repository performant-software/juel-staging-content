Comments from Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"These are the O'Neal twins. I saw their picture on public television in the 1970's." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.  

Additional information about the O'Neal family will be added as it is researched. \*Note: the image is labelled "untitled" in the Holsinger catalogue, and so can't be found if searching by the name "O'Neal" (use ID #X02456A2).

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
