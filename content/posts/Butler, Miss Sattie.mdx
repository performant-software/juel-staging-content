"Miss Sattie Butler," two photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on August 23, 1915 and February 6, 1917.

Note that the man photographed is [Dr. George Ferguson](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1129 "Dr. George Ferguson") ([P48189](/en/people/7873ae7f-1c67-4bc0-8aee-fd0688241706 "P48189")) and the portrait is the same, laterally reversed, as one labelled Dr. G. R. Ferguson.

Additional information about Miss Sattie Butler will be added as it is researched.  
_  
NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
