"Mrs. Frank Higgins," photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on April 5, 1913.

The Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 states the following (possibly the same Frank Higgins photographed): "Higgins, Frank W., trav\[eling\] salesman h\[ome\] 209 2d S W" (p.103).

Additional information about Mrs. Frank Higgins (and the sitters in the photos) will be added as it is researched.

In this instance, Mrs. Frank Higgins (the person whom paid for the photos) may be the woman pictured with the man, and her duaghter, perhaps, may be the child photographed with the African-American woman (perhaps a domestic or nanny). 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._ ![Mrs. Frank Higgins](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1041063/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Mrs. Frank Higgins")
