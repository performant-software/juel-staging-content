"Horse Show Pictures," twenty-three photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on August 4, 1916. 

Eight of the photographs (three included below) clearly show black as well as white individuals in the crowd and tending to the horses. In many of the photographs the lighting / the distance of the camera from the individuals is such that it is not always clear whom is whom - both races appear to be intermingling. 

These photographs are included here in that, although not posed studio portraits of African Americans, they show actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play. They are highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment.  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
