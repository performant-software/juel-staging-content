Holsinger taken on July 15, 1918.</p><p>From 2 August 2019:<br /><br />"Yes, this is my great-great-grandmother - Michelle Tanner..." - Liz Morton&nbsp;</p><p>The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database has an entry about an Ida Scott; it may or may not be the same individual as the woman photographed below: "Ida Scott; died August 13, 1948 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania; buried in Charlottesville, Virginia; approximate age 75 at death" (approximate birth date 1873).</p><p>A photograph of&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1907" target="_blank" title="Scott, Dan">Dan Scott</a>&nbsp;was also taken on July 15, 1918 (with the ID X06467A; the Ida Scott portrait ID is X06468A). Based on their having the same last name, the same date and the consecutive order of the IDs (as entered in Holsinger's ledger), it is highly likely Dan and Ida came together to the portrait studio (although they were not photographed together in one portrait). The relationship between the two individuals is not yet known.</p><p>Additional information about Ida Scott will be added as it is researched.<br /><em><br />NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</em><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049431/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Scott, Ida" title="Scott, Ida" width="778" height="561" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1049431#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=0%2C-37%2C3958%2C2935" target="_blank" title="Scott, Ida">Ida Scott</a>,</span><span class="text_exposed_show">" 1918-07-15 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X06468A)</span><span class="text_exposed_show">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- Comments from 2 August 2019, courtesy Ms. Liz Morton</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
