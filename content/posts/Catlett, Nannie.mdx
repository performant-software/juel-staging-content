"Nannie Catlett," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on February 06, 1915. 

A Nannie Catlett is listed in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database: "Nannie Bland Catlett, birth date unknown, born Albemarle County; mother's maiden name Eliza Blair; died April 3 1955 in Charlottesville and buried in Lincoln Cemetery at age 70 (approximate birth date thus 1885). Nannie Catlett could possibly be the name of a mother who brought her son to be photographed; more information is needed to verify these details, however.

Note that the surname is also noted to have been spelled, "Cattlett" as well.

Additional information about Nannie Catlett will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
