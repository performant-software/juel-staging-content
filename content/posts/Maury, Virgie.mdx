"Virgie Maury," three photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 10 and October 28, 1917.

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database has an entry about a Curtis Maury, which lists a Virgie as his spouse: "Maury, Curtis born September 24 1896 in Albemarle County Virginia to James Edward and Lydia M. (Carr) Maury; died September 28 1936 in Charlottesville Virginia and buried in Oakwood Cemetery; World War 1 \# C-186289."

The database also has an entry about Virgie Maury that is mislabelled by the surname "Murray": "Murray, Virgie born October 27 1901 in Rockingham West Virginia to parents Cuffie Norris and Cornelia Tyrell; died December 31 1936 in Towers Hospital Charlottesville Virginia and buried in Oakwood Cemetery; spouse Curtis Murray, daughter Annie Mae Oliver, New York City."

Additional information about Virgie Maury / the subjects photographed will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
