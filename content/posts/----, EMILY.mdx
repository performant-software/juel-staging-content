Emily (last name unknown), female adult. She is recorded in a list of "Hirelings to be Sent to Captn. Winn ([P47913](/en/people/ad83742b-e627-48d7-add7-fcafca022a6b)), 1 Jany 1828," which lists 11 individuals total. It is not stated clearly whether Cocke sold the slaves to Winn; more likely he contracted them out to Winn based on the prices listed (see the links below for full transcripts of the letter). 

The "hirelings" that were to be sent to [Captn. Winn](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/916 "Captn. Winn") in 1828 were:

A footnote describes Emily's case: "Emily has been left by my Daughter Louisiana ([P47866](/en/people/27edab38-e06d-47dd-9c77-415b07df9ad3 "P47866")) who is desirous to have her put into good hands victuals & clothes & Blanket only, in consideration that she shall be employed part of the time in weaving. She has been brought up in our house & is already able to do common needle work & other Household offices. If you cant dispose of her satisfactorily in reference to the above object, let her return."
