It was not uncommon in this time period to choose to depict oneself in one's work clothing and with accessories/tools of the trade when sitting for a photo, known as "occupational portraits" (Finefield) (for an example, see&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1206" target="_blank" title="Lightfoot, James">James Lightfoot</a>).&nbsp;This portrait, however, gives no indication of the work of the individual below, and so technically is not an occupational portrait, per se: he is dressed in generic laborer's clothing that do not specifically indicate his profession.&nbsp;Perhaps, then, he simply came in to have his portrait taken in the clothing he was wearing at that time.&nbsp;Whether purposefully showcasinghis occupation or not (choosing to be photographed "as is"), these are interesting acts of self-representation.&nbsp;</p><p>Additional information about Will Mobley will be added as it is researched.</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).&nbsp;<br /></em><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1045033/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Mobley, Will" title="Mobley, Will" />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1045033#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=-1%2C-107%2C3939%2C2920" target="_blank" title="Mobley, Will">Will Mobley</a>" 1917-02-03 photograph in UVA Catalogue (X04801A)&nbsp;<br /><br /></span></p><p></p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
