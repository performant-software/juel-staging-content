"Bill Hurley," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 6, 1909. This is the earliest dated portrait of an African American by Holsinger, out of the 11,000 photographs total from his studio (there are other undated photos that appear, based on the subjects' dress, to be of an early date, however the exact date they were taken is not verified; click [here](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1921 "Early African American Photographs") for more information).   
  
Bill Hurley (identity confirmed) was a liveryman, employed by longtime Charlottesville mayor J. Samuel McCue, the latter infamous for being the last person publicly executed in Charlottesville on February 10, 1905 (convicted for the murder of his wife). 

Other photographs that captured a lit cigar/cigarette are [Tommie Mills](https://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1540 "Tommie Mills") and [Will Mobley](https://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1740 "Will Mobley").

Additional information about Bill Hurley will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
