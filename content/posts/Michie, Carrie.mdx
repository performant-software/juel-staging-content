"Carrie Michie," two photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on January 01, 1914.  
  
Note that in 1920, one of the Jefferson Schoolteachers was Carrie Michie (p.77). Likely the photographs below are of her infant. 

Additional information about Carrie Michie will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
