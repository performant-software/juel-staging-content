Robert Battles was a freed man of colour who owned a small farm near the boundaries of the University. His name comes up several times in the [John Hartwell Cocke papers](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/minishowcase2/ "John Hartwell Cocke Papers") surrounding discussions of the purchase of his property by [Cocke](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/648 "JOHN HARTWELL COCKE") ([P43616](/en/people/c61406c9-c83a-4b8b-a093-dccb219d16cb "P43616")). A document signed and dated by Battles on 22 March 1825, for instance, records his having received "six hundred and sixty dollars" from Cocke, as outlined in the 8 March 1825 Deed.
