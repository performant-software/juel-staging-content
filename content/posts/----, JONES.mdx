Jones, male (last name unknown). Owned by [Richard Sandridge](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/526 "Sandridge, Richard") (**[P47067](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47067 "P47067")**), he is mentioned just once in the Proctor's Daybook: "20.00$ Bills Payable draft to Richard Sandridge for this sum deducted from hire on account of expenses in consequence of Jones running off" (July 18, 1825).  
  
Presumably, the amount for the hire of Jones would have been in the range of 60.00 to 65.00$, which was the typical amount paid for other slave men in this same time period (as evidenced in the other entries in the Proctor's Daybook).  

A relation of Richard, Joseph Sandridge (**[P47065](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47065 "P47065")**), also hired out slaves to the university in the same time period.
