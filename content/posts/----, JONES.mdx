<p>Jones, male (last name unknown). Owned by <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/526" title="Sandridge, Richard">Richard Sandridge</a> (<strong><a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47067" title="P47067">P47067</a></strong>), he is mentioned just once in the Proctor's Daybook: "20.00$ Bills Payable draft to Richard Sandridge for this sum deducted from hire on account of expenses in consequence of Jones running off" (July 18, 1825). <br /><br /> Presumably, the amount for the hire of Jones would have been in the range of 60.00 to 65.00$, which was the typical amount paid for other slave men in this same time period (as evidenced in the other entries in the Proctor's Daybook). &nbsp;</p>
