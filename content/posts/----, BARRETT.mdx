Barrett, male, last name unknown; alternate spellings of name were "Barret" and "Barnete." He was hired out to the university several times by Lucy J. Poindexter ([P47091](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47091 "P47091")). The first entry was for a year's hire at $59.25: "Labor acct. draft to bills payable for hire of Negroes to Lucy J. Poindexter for hire of Barnete" (February 24, 1823). A January 1, 1824 entry states, "To Lucy J. Poindexter for Barrett $58" (also, presumably, for a year's hire). 

  
Two entries, both dated April 8, 1825, provide interesting details. At the amount of $56 was recorded, "Bills Payable for draft to H. Watson ([P47102](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47102 "P47102")) for hire of Barrett of L. J. Poindexter." Also recorded was $2 "payable to L. J. Poindexter for this sum deducted from hire of Barret for Raglands for $2." H. Watson was also involved in the hire of Margaret Poindexter's slave, George ([P47104](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47104 "P47104")).
