"Mrs. Allen Perkins," nine photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger. One is dated November 21, 1913, while the other eight are dated November 20, 1913. Three of the photographs are catalogued by the University of Virginia Library, but are unavailable to view since the original negatives are missing.  

The photographs are all of a young boy or girl (about one to three years of age).  Of interest are the four portraits of the child on a windowseat, in which an African American woman can be seen (in two of the portraits) holding up a sheet in order to reflect the natural light (see below). Presumably the woman is the child's nanny or a family employee. Those four portraits are shown below.

Additional information about Mrs. Allen Perkins and the subjects photographed will be added as it is researched.  
_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
