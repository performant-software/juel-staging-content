<p>Untitled Group UVA (X05714B)</p><p>Untitled group portrait at University of Virginia, a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger (date taken unknown). Of interest in this portrait is the African-American gentleman, wearing a Driver's hat, to the right of the group of men. The Library catalogue describes this photo as having been taken at the University of Virginia.</p><p>Photographs were labelled in Holsinger's ledgers by the name of the person whom paid for the portrait; in this instance, no name is associated (perhaps an error in transcribing Holsinger's written ledgers, or, perhaps the writing was illegible for that entry).&nbsp;</p><p>The identity of, and additional information about, the man will be added as it is researched.</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).<br /></em><strong><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1048859/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Untitled Group UVA" title="Untitled Group UVA (X05714B)" width="778" height="561" /><br />SOURCES:</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://v3.lib.virginia.edu/sources/images/items/uva-lib:1048859" target="_blank" title="Untitled Group UVA (X05714B)">Untitled Group UVA</a>," photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X05714B)</span></p><p><strong><br />SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
