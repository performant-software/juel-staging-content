"Ruth Lott," three photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 28, 1916 and February 5, 1919.

The 1916 portraits show two women, and a man and woman; the 1919 portrait shows a single woman.

Additional information about Ruth Lott / the subjects photographed will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
