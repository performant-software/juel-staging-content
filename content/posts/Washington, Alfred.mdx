"Alfred Washington," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on May 08, 1915.

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home database has an entry about an Alfred Washington; it may or may not be about the person photographed below: "Washington, Alfred born December 23, 1895 in Charlottesville Virignia to parents Gus & Martha (Winston) Washington; spouse Fannie; died December 2, 1926 in Albemarle County Virginia; buried at Hickory Hill Cemetery."

The Alfred Washington below may possibly be the same "Alfred Washington, Charlottesville," one of several "colored local men" dispatched on October 29th to camp ("Colored Men to Go Next," 19 October 1917, _Daily Progress_).

Additional information about Alfred Washington will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Washington, Alfred](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1043276/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Washington, Alfred")
