John Herron is mentioned twice in the Proctor's Daybook, in two entries both from September 30, 1823. He presumably was an overseer, and was paid for tailoring work as well. The amount of $23.50 was entered for, "Clothing Acct. to John Herron for making labourers clothing in fall of 1821." The second entry was in the amount of $240.00: "Overseer's acct. to John Herron for wages for 1820 and 1821," or, $120 yearly.
