He presumably was an overseer, and was paid for tailoring work as well. The amount of $23.50 was entered for, "Clothing Acct. to John Herron for making labourers clothing in fall of 1821." The second entry was in the amount of $240.00: "Overseer's acct. to John Herron for wages for 1820 and 1821," or, $120 yearly. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PRIMARY SOURCE INFORMATION</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1.
