"Elnora / Eleanor Carr," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on May 26, 1917 and November 29, 1918.

  
J. F. Bell Funeral Home database lists an Elnora Carr; it may or may not be the same as the individual photographed (to be researched): George Minor Carr, born June 22, 1882 to parents David and Elnora Carr (maiden name Garland) in Albemarle City, Virginia; died September 3, 1933 in Charlottesville, Virginia and buried in Oakwood Cemetery.  

For more information about the Carr/Greer family, visit the [Ivy Creek Foundation Carr/Greer Family Residence](https://ivycreekfoundation.org/carr-greer-family-residence "Ivy Creek Foundation Carr/Greer Family Residence Web Site") web site. 

  
Additional information about Elnora / Eleanor Carr will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
