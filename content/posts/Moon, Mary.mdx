"Mary Moon," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on December 30, 1914.

Note the similarity of the young girl in this photo to that of the girl in the two photos labelled, [John Moon](https://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1533 "John Moon") (taken one month earlier).

Additional information about Mary Moon will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Moon, Mary](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042927/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Moon, Mary")
