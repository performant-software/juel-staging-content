**The _Alumni Bulletin_: An Overview of Topics, 1894-1915** 

The _Alumni Bulletin_ periodical was first published May 1894. It was begun, according to the editorial, to meet:

> . . .the positive demand for some medium through which the University of Virginia may indicate or express the lively and abiding interest and pride she feels, and has always felt, in the distinguished careers of her devoted sons; through which the Alumni may from time to time bear witness to their loyalty, upon which the weal of the University depends; and through which friends of the long ago may learn of each other, that the joyous associations of frank, unselfish youth may be revived, as memory starts at the mention of a name and imagination retouches the pictures of a happy student life. _Alumni Bulletin_, 1.1 (May 1894): 9
