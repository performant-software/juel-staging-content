"Lovegrove Milling Company Charlottesville," a photograph by R. W. Holsinger taken on December 9, 1916.

The signage reads, from left to right, "Lovegrove Milling and Feed Co Flour - Meal - Feed - Hay" and "Lovegrove Milling Co Flour Meal, Millfeed Hay." 

The image shows five men total. On the left, seated in the carriage and holding the reins is an African American gentleman. On the right, there are four white men, two in laborer's clothing. The men, along with the carriage and car, appear to have been posed in front of the building.

This photographs is included here in that, although not a posed studio portraits of African Americans, it does show actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play. It is highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment.

Additional information about the store and the individuals will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._

In this instance, the title does refer to the building (the persons photographed are not verified in terms of identity).
