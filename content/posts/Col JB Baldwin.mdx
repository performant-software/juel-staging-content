J.B. Baldwin (1820-1873), from Augusta County, VA, served on the Board of Visitors from 1855-1864. He is best known for his time as a Confederate colonel from 1861-1862 but also dabbled in politics, serving on the Virginia House of Delegates from 1865-1867. He graduated from Staunton Academy and then the University of Virginia in 1838. As a Whig, Baldwin met with President Lincoln in an attempt to avoid hostile action being directed at the South as the war began, while Lincoln pushed Baldwin to have the Virginia Secession convention adjourn. This meeting also drew the lines between Lincoln’s desires for Virginia to spearhead Union efforts and Baldwin’s advocacy for states’ rights and protections for Virginia. During the war, Baldwin commanded the 52nd Virginia infantry in the western Virginia mountains, but only briefly due to health issues. Baldwin was influential post-war in re-establishing local authority in Staunton, serving as their Speaker of the House in the ensuing years. He emerged as a conservative leader in Virginia who eventually helped negotiate the end of Virginia’s reconstruction with President Ulysses S. Grant. He died in Staunton in 1873.
