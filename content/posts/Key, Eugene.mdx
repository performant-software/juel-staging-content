JUEL ID/KEY: [P48335](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48335 "P48335")

"Eugene Key," photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 1, 1915 and November 23, 1915.

The Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 lists the following about a "Eugene Key"; it may or may not be the same individual as photographed (to be determined): "Keys, Eugene lab h\[ome\] 308th N W"; living at the same address are "Keys, Mozelle dom\[estic\]" and "Keys Frank, butler" (p.119). Note the variations in spelling: Key, Keys, Keyes.

[Mozella Keyes](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1312 "Mozella Keyes") ([P48332](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48332 "P48332")) was also photographed by Holsinger. 

Additional information about Eugene Key will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
