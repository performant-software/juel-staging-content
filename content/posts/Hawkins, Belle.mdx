"Belle Hawkins," three photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on November 9, 1916 and November 17, 1916. 

According to UVA Library's Catalogue, Belle Hawkins also appears in the portrait entitled, "[J. P. Hawkins](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1307 "Hawkins, J. P. ")" (X05430B), "seated front row left hand" (with husband Lewis Hawkins also pictured). Notice that Belle Hawkin is wearing the same gown in the second portrait below) as she is in the J. P. Hawkins group portrait (a long black gown, with detailed beading on the frontispiece). 

To be determined is whether she is related to [Cain Hawkins](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1214 "Mr. and Mrs. Cain Hawkins"). Presumably she is related to [J. P. Hawkins](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1307 "Hawkins, J. P. ") (and the other sitters, in addition to her husband, in the group portrait)? 

Additional information about Belle Hawkins will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
