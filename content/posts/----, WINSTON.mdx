Winston (last name unknown), adult male, is recorded in a January 1, 1824 entry in the Proctor's Daybook. Owned by Ralph S. Dickerson ([P47019](/en/people/d0c96fe6-3e90-48fd-8168-ed7fd57d182a "P47019")), he was hired out to the university accompanied by [Nelson](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/443#overlay=node/444 "Nelson") and [Jef](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/443#overlay=node/443 "Jef"): "To Ralph S. Dickerson for Jef: $58, for Nelson: $58, for Winston: $55." Note the slight difference in cost for hiring Winston than Jef and Nelson (although no other records are known of as of yet that explain the reason for this discrepancy).
