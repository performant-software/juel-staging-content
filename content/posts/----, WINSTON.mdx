<p>Winston (last name unknown), adult male, is recorded in a January 1, 1824 entry in the Proctor's Daybook. Owned by Ralph S. Dickerson (<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47019" title="P47019">P47019</a>), he was hired out to the university accompanied by <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/443#overlay=node/444" title="Nelson">Nelson</a> and <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/443#overlay=node/443" title="Jef">Jef</a>: "To Ralph S. Dickerson for Jef: $58, for Nelson: $58, for Winston: $55." Note the slight difference in cost for hiring Winston than Jef and Nelson (although no other records are known of as of yet that explain the reason for this discrepancy).&nbsp;</p>
