Daniel Watson, a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on June 16, 1914.

The young man photographed may possibly be the "Daniel Watson, Burnleys," one of several "colored local men" dispatched on October 29th to camp ("Colored Men to Go Next," 19 October 1917, _Daily Progress_).

Additional information about Daniel Watson will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Watson, Daniel](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042194/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Watson, Daniel")
