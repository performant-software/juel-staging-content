"Edward Mayo," photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 20, 1917 and November 24, 1917.

From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019: 

"He was a fireman on the Southern Railroad." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day.   

The Daily Progress of 1918 lists that Edward Mayo was among the men called by the local draft board for physical examination: 

Additional information about Edward Mayo will be added as it is researched. Note there are two portraits of Mr. Mayo, labelled Edward and Edwin (although the same person).

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
