"Horse (With House)," nine photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger, date unknown (the University of Virginia library catalogue lists the date range as ~1889/1930). 

Photographs were labelled in Holsinger's ledgers by the name of the person whom paid for the portrait; in this instance, no name is associated. The date is also not known, again, likely due to an error in legibility or transcription.

Of the nine photographs, the one below (U00341B) shows most clearly the African American man. The second photograph below shows an additional African American man walking past. 

The identity of, and additional information about, the man will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
