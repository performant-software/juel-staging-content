Kezia Davis, adult female, a free colored woman. She is mentioned briefly in the Proctor's Daybook. On November 17, 1827, an entry notes the payment of $2.00 from "Sundries Draft to A. Garrett Library for cash paid Keziah Davis for making Table covers." Alexander Garrett ([P43628](/en/people/dbd71b26-9277-4c5d-81da-e1bbf042ea9a "P43628")) was the first Bursar of the University of Virginia. On September 11, 1828, Kezia was paid 0.75 cents "for making clothes for Zack." 

Of the many business accounts mentioned in the financial records of the University of Virginia in its first years, the small portion of those that involved women were for the most part for making clothes or blankets for hired workers. See, for instance, the entry for [Sally Henry](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/576 "HENRY, SALLY") (who was also paid the same amount).
