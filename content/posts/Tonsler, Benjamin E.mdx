Tonsler died on March 6, 1917 from pneumonia; he lived from 1854-1917.&nbsp;The photograph is dated March 10, showing the casket and the many floral tributes on the day of his funeral. Some of the wreaths that can be read include, "Choir 1st Baptist," "Faculty," "INM...". The casket would have been on view at his home, which was on Sixth Street (below). The house is on the <a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/104-0233/" target="_blank" title="Benjamin Tonsler House">Virginia Historic Register</a>.</p><p>Mr. Tonsler, former student of the Hampton Institute and Principal at the <a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/104-5087/" target="_blank" title="Jefferson School">Jefferson School</a>, is buried alongside his wife (Fannie Gildersleeve Tonsler) and several members of his family at the Daughters of Zion Cemetery.

E. Tonsler was registered as a qualified voter in Charlottesville's Fourth Ward for the November 1902 election (the first one following the change in Virginia's Constitution, which had disenfranchised many African Americans). The below article from the Daily Progress notes,&nbsp;â€œThe Board of Registrars for the fourth ward of the city was comprised of Messrs. Thomas S. Jones, chairman, Roy K. Flannagan and Water Dinwiddie. The board registered during its sitting the following qualified voters":&nbsp;</p><p>"J. Allen, Robt.

His wife was Fannie Gildersleeve Tonsler; together they had six children&nbsp;</p><p>The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database has an entry about a relation of Mr. Tonsler's, named "Lloyd Benjamin Tonsler": "born June 14, 1883 in Virginia to parents Horace E. Tonsler and Pocahantas Woods; died July 4, 1967 in UVA Hospital in Charlottesville Virginia; buried in Oakwood Cemetery; wife Mary N. Tonsler died March 1958; brother Julius Tonsler of Bluefield West Virginia; sister Pocahantas Jackson of Newport News Virginia."&nbsp;</p><p><span>The Tonsler family was one of several prominent African American families in Charlottesville at the time of this photograph, many of whom were also photographed by Holsinger: the Coles's, Bell's, Tonsler's, Inge's,and Jackson's (for more information, see the link to "The Four Hundreds Club" below). These prominent families had fashioned themselves as the "Four Hundreds Club," deriving the name from each family's achievement in being able to purchase a 400$ plot of land in Charlottesville. Not an official club, the "Four Hundreds" was rather an informal social gathering and way to acknowledge the accomplishments of these families not only within the African American community but also in Charlottesville community and beyond.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Additional information about Benjamin E. Tonsler will be added as it is researched.</span></p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).<br /></em></p><p><span><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1045166/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Tonsler, Benjamin" title="Tonsler, Benjamin E." width="778" height="561" />&nbsp;<br /></span><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1045166#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=-344%2C0%2C6474%2C4799" target="_blank" title="Tonsler, Benjamin E.">Benjamin E.
