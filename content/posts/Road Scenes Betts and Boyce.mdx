<p>"Road Scenes Betts and Boyce," five photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on November 1, 1911. They show the paving of East High Street, Charlottesville.</p><p>The photographs appear in a sequence, showing the making of a road. The library catalogue states this is East High Street, Charlottesville being constructed/paved.&nbsp;Below are the two photographs that include African Americans (the final three just show the completed road). Betts and Boyce company was based in nearby Harrisonburg, Virginia (west of Charlottesville).</p><p>The first photograph (X05664B3) shows three laborers, the two in the foreground African American.</p><p>The second photograph (X05664B4) shows four laborers total.</p><p>These photographs are included here in that, although not posed studio portraits of African Americans, they do show actual interactions between white and black citizens at a time when segregation due to Jim Crow laws was in play. They are highly valuable in providing "visual evidence" of that lived environment.</p><p>More details will be added as they are found.</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).&nbsp;</em></p><p>Below:&nbsp;X05664B3<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1048768/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Road Scenes Betts and Boyce" title="Road Scenes Betts and Boyce" width="778" height="561" /></p><p>Below: X05664B4<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1048769/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Road Scenes Betts and Boyce" title="Road Scenes Betts and Boyce" width="778" height="561" /><br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;"<a href="https://v3.lib.virginia.edu/sources/images/items/uva-lib:1048768" title="Road Scenes Betts and Boyce">Road Scenes Betts and Boyce</a>,"&nbsp;1917-11-01, photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X05664B3) &nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;"<a href="https://v3.lib.virginia.edu/sources/images/items/uva-lib:1048769" title="Road Scenes Betts and Boyce">Road Scenes Betts and Boyce</a>,"&nbsp;1917-11-01, photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X05664B4) &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
