<p>Robertson served on the Board of Visitors from 1853-1859, an alumni of the University. Born in Albemarle, Robertson&rsquo;s career revolved around the city and state as he became Albemarle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Commonwealth Attorney&rdquo; in 1851 and later served as a judge on the Court of Appeals from 1859-1865. As a judge, Robertson was well known within the Virginia law community. At his memorial, S.V.
