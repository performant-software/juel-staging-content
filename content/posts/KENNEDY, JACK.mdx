<p>Jack Kennedy, male, is mentioned in the Chairman's Journal of 1833.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Jack Kennedy, a mulatto man, having applied for one of the cellar rooms [of the hotels] for a barber's shop for the accommodation of students," was favorably received by the Proctor, who thought it would be good for keeping students out of town; the Chairman voices concern to make sure Jack does not "aid students in violation of enactments."<br /><br /></p>
