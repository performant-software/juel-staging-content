Jack Kennedy, male, is mentioned in the Chairman's Journal of 1833.

"Jack Kennedy, a mulatto man, having applied for one of the cellar rooms \[of the hotels\] for a barber's shop for the accommodation of students," was favorably received by the Proctor, who thought it would be good for keeping students out of town; the Chairman voices concern to make sure Jack does not "aid students in violation of enactments."
