"Willie Wood," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on December 20, 1916.

An African-American man of the same name is listed in the Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15: "Wood William, waiter h\[ome\] 500m E South \[Street\]" (p. 197); it may or may not be the same individual as photographed below.   
  
Additional information about Willie Wood will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Wood, Willie](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1044923/full/561,778/0/default.jpg "Wood, Willie")
