JUEL ID/KEY: [P48198  
  
](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48198 "P48198")William E. Eutsler was an employee of [R. W. Holsinger](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1078 "R. W. Holsinger") ([P48008](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48008 "P48008")), working at Holsinger's photography studio in some capacity; dates of employment thus far are only known with certainty to be 1914-15, when he and only one other employee are listed ([Claudius B. McCollister](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1160 "Claudius B. McCollister")) in the _Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15._ Likely he was assisting in setting up the studio, cameras, developing the film, assisting with the sitters, and even operating the camera himself (although Holsinger, as owner of the studio, would be attributed as the photographer, as is typical of the time period).

The _Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15_ lists "Eutsler William E., photo University Studio h\[ome\] 1200 Wertland" (p81). Living at the same address was Miss Isabelle Eutsler and Miss Louis E. Eutsler (below):

(Note: R. W. Holsinger's Studio produced three images labelled, "Eutsler Brothers Albemarle County" dated August 3, 1914. It is unclear if the Eutsler men pictured in the images are related to the employee William).
