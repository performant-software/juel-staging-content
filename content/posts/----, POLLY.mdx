Polly (last name unknown), female adult. She is recorded in a list of "Hirelings to be Sent to Captn. Winn ([P47913](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P47913)), 1 Jany 1828," which lists 11 individuals total. It is not stated clearly whether Cocke sold the slaves to Winn; more likely he contracted them out to Winn based on the prices listed (see the links below for full transcripts of the letter). 

The "hirelings" that were to be sent to [Captn. Winn](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/916 "Captn. Winn") in 1828 were: 

[Dinah](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/847 "DINAH") (P47885), Polly (P47886) and "[](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/848 "----, POLLY")her child [anon0064](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/917 "----, ANON0064") ([P47979](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47979 "P47979")) and nurse [anon0065](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/919 "anon0065") ([P47980](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P47980 "P47980"))," [Dilcy](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/849 "----, DILCY") (P47887), [Bibbianna](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/850 "----, BIBBIANNA") (P47888), [Aggy](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/851 "----, AGGY") (P47889), [Emily](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/852 "----, EMILY") (P47890), [Jenny](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/853 "----, JENNY") (P47891), [Louisa](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/854 "----, LOUISA") (P47892), and [Fanney](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/855 "----, FANNEY") (P47893).

Polly is noted to come with a "\[deft\] Blanket & Hat." A note also describes her thus: "At the treaty of this woman, I have consented to her leaving her child & nurse." A subsequent note then states, "The woman Polly changed her notion & requests for her child & nurse to go with her, I have therefore hired her in that way."
