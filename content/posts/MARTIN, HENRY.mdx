Henry Martin (William Henry Martin, July 4, 1826 to October 5, 1915) is perhaps one of the most well-known of African Americans associated with the early years of the University of Virginia, in part due to his long career at the University as "Bell-Ringer," a posting he fulfilled until retirement in 1909 (_Corks and Curls_).

_From Family Photo Day, 9 March 2019:_  
"This was \[like\] the curfew bell. It stayed at the top of the Firehouse, and a black man would ring it every night at 9pm. When you heard the bell, you had to be in your yard. The firehouse was at the bottom of Vinegar Hill"; "He was \[like\] the bell ringer of the curfew bell. He is ringing it for the curfew at 9 o'clock at the firehouse in Vinegar Hill." - Mr. Melvin Flannagan Jr., participant at Family Photo Day. (_NOTE_: the photos of Henry Martin ringing the campus bell reminded Mr. Flannagan of other curfew bells used in the Jim Crow era.)

Mr. Martin's grandson, James P. Fleming, Jr., was married to [Maude Henry](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1362 "Henry, Maude"), who was also photographed by Holsinger.   
  
The J. F. Bell Funeral Home database states of her husband James P. Fleming: "born January 15 1905 in Charlottesville VA to father James P. Fleming and mother Mary Calloway, died March 11 1983 at University of Virignia Hospital. Buried in Oakwood Cemetery. Daughters Ruth Hunt, Marilyn Mahanand, spouse Maude Henry Fleming."

The photo below (likely taken by Miss Anna Berringer, around 1897-1900, in the Berringer Family Album) shows Martin before the Chapel.

![Henry Martin](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/media/images/HenryMartin-nearChapel.jpeg "Henry Martin")

Born on July 4, 1826, at Jefferson's Monticello - on the day of Jefferson's death - Martin was sold to the Carr family, who lived outside Charlottesville in the property they called "Bentivar." 

The date at which he began employ at the University is unknown, with different accounts giving different dates. Martin is said to have stated he began as bell-ringer in 1856 (unknown source), while other sources state 1868 (including Patton's article, link below). As early as 1846-7, however, he was certainly employed within the general university area (if not officially employed by the University itself). He was "hired out" at several points, working at Mrs. Carr's ([P47443](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P47443#m1 "P47443")) boarding house, "hauling wood" between Bentivar and the University, and aiding Drs. Theodore Michie [(P30254)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P30254) and James L. Cabell [(P39304)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=P39304) at the hospital during the Civil War.

Other information gathered about Martin include that he was a member of the First Baptist Church of Charlottesville (an unverified source describes him as having been a Deacon of the church) and that he lived in a house near the University on 10th street (location to be determined). 

Due to his consistent service as Bell-Ringer and association with the University for "a period of sixty years," there is a relatively large number of references to and photographs of Martin (see the [Henry Martin Photos and Interview (1914 Corks and Curls), page 1](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/361 "Henry Martin Corks & Curls 1914 Interview 1 of 3") / [page 2](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/362 "Henry Martin Interview, Corks and Curls, 1914 page 2 of 3") / [page 3](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/363 "Henry Martin Corks & Curls 1914 interview page 3 of 3"). While he is photographed and written about in stereotypical ways - posed, for instance, in his (unofficial) uniform before the chapel, and written about paternalistically as "simple," "faithful," and "dignified" - the sources vary in the degree to which they rely on these stereotypes. The interview of Martin published in the 1914 UVA yearbook _Corks and Curls_ may take too much liberty in its "dramatic monologue" of Henry's own words (Martin said to have been literate, contrary to his depiction therein) \[although the 1900 Federal Census lists him as unable to read and write\]. Other references seem to capture interactions with Martin less than an generalized character study, such as the following reminiscence by alumnus Thomas Nelson Page (1873-4) ([P30192](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=30192 "P30192")): "I was standing my B. L. examination in the old chapel. . .and Henry had brought my dinner. I was pretty lonesome, and felt like a doomed prisoner writing his last confession. He said, 'Mr. Page, I'm prayin' for you.' .  .  . I think he must have helped me, for I got through. And I know I have never forgotten him . . . He is as much a part of the University, in my mind, as is Mr. Jefferson."

Also of interest is the February 15, 1909 letter (see image below):   
"This letter was dictated to \[\] Cokce by uncle Henry Martin. 'I came to the Univ of Virginia in 1848. I was nineteen years old at that time. I had a letter concerning my character from my master Sr. Carr, this letter was given to the second Proctor, Col Kemper. Dr Carr bought me, my mother, and twin brother at Thos Jefferson's sale which took place six months after Mr. Jefferson's death. I came here while I was quite a boy, and I have always tried to behave myself and I have always been obedient and honest I have served \[nine?\] Proctors and twenty eight professors Prof \[F?} H Smith is the only professor here now who was here when I first came to the University. I am probably more widely known than other colored man in the United States especially by the students who have been at the University while I have been here No doubt when I quit another Henry may fill my place but it won't be the same Henry that has had the job for so long a time. Prof Minor and Dr Maupin said that I was the most prompt man that they ever saw. Thunder and lightning don't stop me I come every morning and always get up at four o'clock.'"

\- From the CHARLES H BULLOCK SR MEMOIRS: “Regarding Uncle Henry Martin.... he had this to say: Henry Martin was twice married. His first wife had been Charles Bullock’s aunt, sister of his father, Burkley Bullock....He had always been told that Henry Martin was a grandson of Thomas Jefferson....."; "....Uncle Henry, as all who knew him affectionately called him, was head janitor at the University of Virginia. His chief job was to ring the large college bell which hung in the rotunda. He was the grandson of Thomas Jefferson. He was tall and stately and held the respect of the professors and students as well as the town of Charlottesville." (Courtesy: Preservers of the Daughters of Zion Cemetery Facebook Group)

\- Note that Henry Martin appears to be in a [group photo](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/2064 "1908 and 1913 Clan Barbecue") from 1908 ("1908 and 1913 Clan Barbecue," Rufus W. Holsinger).
