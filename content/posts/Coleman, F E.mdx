Holsinger taken on August 6, 1918.</p><p>A man named Frank Coleman is recorded in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home database; it may or may not be the same man as the subject in the below photograph (although the age of the subject photographed appears to match the funeral home record): Frank Coleman, born March 18, 1893; died November 2, 1965 at University Hospital Charlottesville and was buried at Lincoln Cemetery. There is an entry about his spouse, Viola Johnson Coleman, as well: born August 15, 1902; died January 5, 1958 and buried as well at Lincoln Cemetery. Their five children are James Coleman, Richard Coleman, Louise Howard, Virginia Lilard, and Mary Banner.&nbsp;</p><p><br />Note that the same man is in another photo by Holsinger labelled, "<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1476" target="_blank" title="Coleman, Frank">Frank Coleman</a>," taken on June 10, 1918. The identity of the girl in the portrait is unknown.</p><p><br />The 1910 Charlottesville Census has an entry about a ¨F. M. E. Coleman" that may or may not be about the woman photographed below: ¨Coleman, F. M. E., 18, female, black, born in Virginia; can read and write and attended school in the past year; family number 342; residing at 595 Park Street, Charlottesville Virginia.¨ This record may or may not be about the same young woman in the portrait below; more information is needed.</p><p>&nbsp;<br />Additional information about F. E. Coleman will be added as it is researched.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</em></p><p>Below: X06555A<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049539/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg" alt="Coleman, F. E." title="Coleman. F.
