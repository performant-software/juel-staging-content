"Virgie Brown," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on July 3, 1917 and July 20, 1917.

The 1910 Census has information about a Virgie Brown, which may or may not be about the same girl photographed below; the recorded age does seem to match with the apparent age/appearance of the girl photographed, so does seem likely to be about the same individual: "Virgie Brown, 5, female, black, born in Virginia; house number 213, family number 88, street/neighborhood Cox's Row, Charlottesville."

Additional information about Virgie Brown will be added as it is researched.  
  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
