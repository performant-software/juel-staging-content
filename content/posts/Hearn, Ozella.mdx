Holsinger taken on December 12, 1914.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 lists the following about an Ozella Hearn (may be the same individual, or relation): "Hearn, Ozella, teacher, h[ome] 708 Page St." (p 101).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Mrs. Ozella Hearn Myers was the daughter of William Hearn and Sarah (Brackett) Hearn, and the granddaughter of Mary Ann Brackett who is buried at the Daughters of Zion Cemetery (Burial List, 16 July 2019).&nbsp;Ozella Hearn is also buried there as well.</span></p><p>The 1910 Charlottesville Census has an entry about an "Ozilla Hearn" (note the alternate spelling of the first name); it may or may not be about the individual photographed below: "Ozilla Hearn, 17, female, black, born in Virginia; can read, write, and attended school the prior year; house number 708; family number 31, residing at Page Street, Charlottesville."</p><p>The appearance/apparent age of the subject photographed below (21, based on the age in the 1910 census) does seem to match with the census entry; more information is needed, however, to verify if the entry and photograph are of the same person.</p><p>Additional information about Ozella Hearn will be added as it is researched.&nbsp;</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</em></p><p>Below: X02898A2<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042893/full/778,561/0/default.jpg" alt="Hearn, Ozella" title="Hearn, Ozella" /></p><p>Below: X02898A<br /><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042892/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg" alt="Hearn, Ozella" title="Hearn, Ozella" width="1000" height="1337" /><br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1042893#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=0%2C-83%2C4019%2C2980" target="_blank" title="Hearn, Ozella">Ozella Hearn</a>" 1914-12-12 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X02898A2)&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">-&nbsp;"<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1042892#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=-1291%2C-1%2C5406%2C4008" target="_blank" title="Hearn, Ozella">Ozella Hearn</a>" 1914-12-12 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X02898A)&nbsp;</span></p><p>- Daughters of Zion Cemetery Burial List, 16 July 2019 (courtesy The&nbsp;Preservers of the Daughters of Zion Cemetery)</p><p>- <a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/census/search_popcensus.cgi?search_type=individ&amp;id=429&amp;year=1910&amp;community=%" target="_blank" title="Hearn, Ozella">Ozella Hearn entry in 1910 Census</a></p><p><strong><br />SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
