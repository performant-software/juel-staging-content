"Alfred Howard," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on October 03, 1916 and October 2, 1914.

Both portraits are labelled Alfred Howard; presumably, the boy on the left in the first portrait below is Alfred Howard (and the identity of the second young man is unknown).

Additional information about Alfred Howard will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
