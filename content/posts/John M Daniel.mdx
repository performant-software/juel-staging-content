Besides serving on the Virginia Board of Visitors from 1864-1865, John M. Daniel (1825-1865) held many roles in politics and law during his career. He was a member of the Council of State, a diplomat, an editor at the Richmond Examiner, a staff officer in the Confederate army under General John B. Floyd, and attorney general of Virginia. Daniel studied law in his hometown of Stafford, VA. He initially opposed slavery but became a pro-slavery advocate through the persuasion of his granduncle. He is also known for his complaints about Turin, Italy, where he expressed that “the women were uglier than in the United States” and that “the country stank of garlic.” As an officer in the Civil War, Daniel suffered wounds at the Battle of Gaines’ Mill and died of tuberculosis in 1865. Daniel was also a friend of Edgar Allen Poe, of whom he wrote “a remarkable sketch.”
