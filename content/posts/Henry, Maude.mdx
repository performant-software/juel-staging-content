Holsinger on June 7, 1917.&nbsp;</p><p>Mrs. Maude Henry Fleming, educator and librarian, was the wife of Mr. James Pendleton "Penny" Fleming, Jr., who was the son of James P. Fleming, Sr., a barber. He was the grandson of University of Virginia bell ringer and janitor <a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/366" target="_blank" title="Martin, Henry">Henry Martin</a>. Maude is buried at the Daughters of Zion Cemetery (Burial List, 16 July 2019).</p><p>The 1910 Census has an entry about a Maude Henry that may be about the same individual as photographed below: "Maude Fleming, age 10, female, mulatto; born in Virginia; can read, write, and attended school the previous year; house number 838; family number 140; residing at Estes Street, Charlottesville." The age recorded in the 1910 Census does seem to match with the apparent age/appearance of the girl photographed below (who would be 17 in 1917, the date of the portrait); more information is needed, however, to verify whether the subject photographed is the same as the entrant in the census.</p><p>The J. F. Bell Funeral Home database also has the following entry under Maude Elizabeth Fleming (nee Henry): "Born January 30 1900 in Charlottesville VA, father Nelson Samuel Henry, mother Rosa Richardson, died December 18 1985 at University of Virginia Hospital. Husband died March 11 1983, daughters Ruth Hunt Philadelphia, Marilyn Mahanand, Silver Springs Md. Spouse James P. Fleming (Jr.)."</p><p>The J. F. Bell Funeral Home database states of her husband James P. Fleming: "born January 15 1905 in Charlottesville VA to father James P. Fleming and mother Mary Calloway, died March 11 1983 at University of Virignia Hospital. Buried in Oakwood Cemetery. Daughters Ruth Hunt, Marilyn Mahanand, spouse Maude Henry Fleming."</p><p>Additional information will be added as it is researched.&nbsp;</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</em><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1048081/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg" alt="Henry, Maude" title="Henry, Maude" width="1000" height="1337" /><br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">- "<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1048081#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=-1257%2C-1%2C5342%2C3961" target="_blank" title="Henry, Maude">Maude Henry</a>," 1917-06-07 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X05208A)&nbsp;</span></p><p>- Daughters of Zion Cemetery Burial List, 16 July 2019 (courtesy The&nbsp;Preservers of the Daughters of Zion Cemetery)</p><p>- <a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/census/search_popcensus.cgi?search_type=individ&amp;id=116&amp;year=1910&amp;community=%" target="_blank" title="Henry, Maude">Maude Henry entry, 1910 Census</a></p><p>- <a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/search_funeral.cgi?start_page=0&amp;f_name=&amp;p_name=&amp;last=fleming&amp;first=Maude&amp;b_month=&amp;b_day=&amp;b_year-ops=%3C&amp;b_year=&amp;b_place=&amp;d_month=&amp;d_day=&amp;d_year-ops=%3C&amp;d_year=&amp;d_place=&amp;burial=" target="_blank" title="Maude Henry">Maude Henry entry</a>, J.
