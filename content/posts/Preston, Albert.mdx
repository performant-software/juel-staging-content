"Albert Preston," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on June 12, 1916.

The Charlottesville City Directory 1914-15 lists an "Albert Preston"; this may or may not be the same individual (to be determined): "Preston Albert, janitor h\[ome\] 412 Oak" (p.153).   

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home database also has information about an Albert Preston, which may or may not be the same individual in question: "Albert Pillsbury Preston; born March 15, 1893 in Charlottesville, Virginia to parents Thomas Preston and Nammie Rouser; died September 5, 1965; place of death 412 5th St SW Charlottesville; buried at Oakwood Cemetery. He was married to Jean Coles Preston; sons Albert, Herbert, Robert, George, Edward and Charlie Preston; daughter June Bailey; sisters Susan Waddy, Julia Anderson.

Additional information about Albert Preston will be added as it is researched.

It is not yet known whether Albert Preston is related to [William Preston](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/735 "Preston, William"), former employee at the University. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Preston, Albert](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1044221/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Preston, Albert")
