Anon0004 is a male servant of Dr. Magill. He is indirectly mentioned in the Chairman's Journals entry for March 11, 1836:

"I was informed to day by Mr. Penci ([P43877](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43877#m1 "P43877")) that the servants in the University are in the habit of furnishing expensive suppers to the students; & that a small negro boy ([P46981](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=46981#m1 "P46981")) who is often going about selling apples to the students, frequently carries breakfast to their rooms, in his covered basket, which I supposed contained nothing but apples. This boy belonging to no one in the University, but living with a free woman ([P44621](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=44621 "P44621")), the wife of Dr. Magill's ([P43655](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43655#m1 "P43655")) servant ([P44622](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=44622 "P44622")), in the basement of Mr. Roger's ([P43658](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43658#m1 "P43658")) house \[Pavilion VI, [PL8458](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=8458#m1 "PL8458")\], I had him sent out of the University immediately."
