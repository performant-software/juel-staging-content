"R. B. Crawford children," twelve photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 19, 1915.

The photographs show the mother and two young boys; three of the photographs show the two children in riding wear; one of the photographs (below) shows an African-American man assisting them.

Additional information about the African-American individual will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger) =_ In this instance, based on other photographs in the catalogue (of the children and mother), the African-American gentleman photographed is not R. B. Crawford.
