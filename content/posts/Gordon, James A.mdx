"James A. Gordon," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on March 10, 1917.

There are several Gordons listed in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database, two of which are James Andrew Gordon and James Armistead Gordon. The latter, James Armistead, could possibly be the same person as the subject photographed: "James Armistead, born May 1 1890 in Greenwood Virginia; mother's maiden name Maggie Gordon and spouse Ella; died April 8 1931 in Greenwood Virginia and buried in Greenwood Cemetery." 

Additional information about James A. Gordon will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Gordon, James A.](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1045173/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Gordon, James A.")
