"Carrie Coles," two photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on July 20, 1912.

A branch of the Coles family was settled in the Proffitt area of Albemarle county; the [Coles Family Cemetery](http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/cem/db/cemetery/details/CLS/ "Coles Family Cemetery") has a listing for a Carrie Coles: born 1907, died 1931. Whether this individual is the same as the second child pictured below is not certain.

  
Additional information about Carrie Coles will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
