](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48251 "P48251")

A scene before "W. J. Parr & Son," labelled, "Parr Wholesale House Charlottesville," photographed by R. W. Holsinger.  

The exterior shot shows signage reading, "W. J. Parr & Son Feed & Groceries," "Poultry Supplies," "Hay, Grain, Flour, Meal", etc.

The 1914-15 Charlottesville City Directory provides additional information about the business. William J. Parr ([P48317](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48317 "P48317")) and son Irving Parr ([P48318](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48318 "P48318")) were listed as owners: "Parr W J & Son \[William J and Irvine W\], feed 400-404 E Market", "W J P & Son" (p147).

Additional information about the store and the individuals will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._

In this instance, the title does refer to the building (the persons photographed are not verified in terms of identity).
