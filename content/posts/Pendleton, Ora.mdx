"Ora Pendleton," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on November 15, 1918. 

Note that in the second photograph below, the individual is wearing a circular badge (?) that says, "Winston & Co 28102" and a third line that is illegible. As of yet, it is unclear what the badge means. A "Winston & Co." is described as a contractor in Richmond, Virginia, in this time period; also, a "Peter Winston & Co." was a publisher of the nearby Farmville, Virginia newspaper. 

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database lists a **C**ora Pendleton, died June 29, 1940 in Washington D.C., and buried in Charlottesville, VA at the age of 65. (Possible spouse to Frank Pendleton, died July 25, 1934). This could possibly be the same woman, with her name having been mispelled (or mistranscribed) from Holsingerś ledgers. More information is needed to verify whether the entry refers to the same young woman as photographed below.  
  

Additional information about Ora Pendleton will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
