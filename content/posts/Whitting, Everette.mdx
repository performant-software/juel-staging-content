"Everette Whitting," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on September 27, 1918.

Photographs of [Lily Whitting](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1917 "Lily Whitting") and of [Lulla Whitting](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1918 "Whitting, Lulla") were also taken on September 27, 1918. The portrait ID for Lily is X06784A; for Lulla, X06783A; and for Everette, X06785A. Based on their having the same last name, same date, and the consecutive order of the IDs (as entered in Holsinger's ledger), it is highly likely Everette, Lily, and Lulla came together to the portrait studio (although they were not photographed together in one portrait). The relationship between the three individuals is not yet known.

Additional information about Everette Whitting will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Whitting, Everette](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049808/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Whitting, Everette")
