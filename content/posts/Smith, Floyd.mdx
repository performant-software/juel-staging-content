"Floyd Smith," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on June 11, 1918.

The Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15 lists a "Floyd Smith"; it may or may not be the same individual as the person photographed below: "Smith, Floyd, barber h\[ome\] 209 6th N W" (p.168).

Additional information about Floyd Smith will be added as it is researched.  
   
_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) photographed, but rather the name of the person who paid for it when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Smith, Floyd](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1049257/full/778,561/0/default.jpg "Smith, Floyd")
