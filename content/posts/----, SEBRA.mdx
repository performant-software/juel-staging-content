A relatively large number of primary records exist that provide insight into slave ownership and the historical context of University of Virginia. Likely the Shiflett Plantation was the plot of land that Shiflett had bought (deed signed August 1802) that was part of the "Rennett Henderson" estate, which was near the Rivanna River and Milton, VA (now Milton Road area, to the east of Charlottesville), Albemarle County (source Edgar Woods, <em>Albemarle County in Virginia</em>).<br />&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>&nbsp;</div><p><strong>PRIMARY SOURCE INFORMATION</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1.
