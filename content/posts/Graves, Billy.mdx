"Billy Graves," two photographs taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on April 24, 1912.

The Charlottesville City Directory, 1914-15, has the following entry about a William Graves (it may or may not be the same person as the sitter in the portrait): "Graves, William C., Charlottesville Lumber Co. h\[ome\] Lahore, VA" (p.93). 

Additional information about Billy Graves will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).
