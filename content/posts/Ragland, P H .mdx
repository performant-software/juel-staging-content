"P. H. Ragland," a photograph taken by Rufus W. Holsinger on January 16, 1913.

The J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database lists information about a Percy Howard Ragland; this may or may not be the same individual as the P. H. Ragland photographed below: "Percy Howard Ragland, died July 5, 1937 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and buried in Charlottessville, Virginia. Approximate age 34." More information is needed.

Holsinger took another portrait of P. H. Ragland on April 29, 1912 (X00167A); this portrait is not labelled "P. H. Ragland" in the UVA library catalogue / Holsinger ledgers but is untitled. 

Additional information about P. H. Ragland will be added as it is researched.

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled is not necessarily the name of the sitter in the portrait, unless otherwise verified (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
