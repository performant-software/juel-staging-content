Sally Henry, female, is mentioned in one entry in the Proctor's Daybook. On August 6, 1828, Sally Henry was paid 0.75 cents "for making Henry's clothes." Of the many business accounts mentioned in the financial records of the University of Virginia in its first years, the small portion of those that involved women were for the most part for making clothes or blankets for hired workers. See, for instance, the entry for [Kezia Davis](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/575 "DAVIS, KEZIA") (who was also paid the same amount).
