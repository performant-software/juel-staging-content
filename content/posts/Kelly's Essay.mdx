put your text, et al, here.

Remember this is an "html" editor, thus the several html oriented items on the toolbar.

Sometimes cut-and-paste from a Word doc leads to difficulties (the html editor might not like items from the doc).

If so, undue the paste (or if that is all you've done since opening the edit form, you can just go to View of the node and then select Edit again - the changes will not be saved) then do a save-as from Word into a .txt file, that is, is plain text, then do the cut-and-paste from the .txt file.

Remember to always (if you have made edits you want to keep) go to the bottom of this page and select Save!
