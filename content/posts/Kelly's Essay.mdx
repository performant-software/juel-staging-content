<p>put your text, et al, here.</p>
<p>Remember this is an &quot;html&quot; editor, thus the several html oriented items on the toolbar.</p>
<p>Sometimes cut-and-paste from a Word doc leads to difficulties (the html editor might not like items from the doc).</p>
<p>If so, undue the paste (or if that is all you&#39;ve done since opening the edit form, you can just go to View of the node and then select Edit again - the changes will not be saved) then do a save-as from Word into a .txt file, that is, is plain text, then do the cut-and-paste from the .txt file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember to always (if you have made edits you want to keep) go to the bottom of this page and select Save!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
