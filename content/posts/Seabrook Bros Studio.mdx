The Seabrook Bros. was a photography studio located at **403 E Main Street**, Charlottesville in 1905. Advertising in _Madison Hall Notes_, (weekly publication of UVA's Young Mens Christian Association) in 1905, Seabrook Bros. described themselves as  "high-class photographers" with "all work strictly first-class." Although Holsinger continued advertising in _Madison Hall Notes_ in 1906, Seabrook Bros. no longer did. The exact years of operation, and by whom, are not yet verified. Note that the "**[New Era / Gitchell's Studio](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1145 "New Era / Gitchell Studio ")**" ([CB1144](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=CB1144 "CB1144")) was also located at 403 E Main Street at a later date (1914-15). 

The following Studio ad appeared forty times in _Madison Hall Notes_ 1905-6:
