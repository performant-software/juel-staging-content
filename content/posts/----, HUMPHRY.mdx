Humphry, male, last name unknown. He is mentioned alongside Primus ([P47036](/en/people/3ff7eec8-4efe-490d-8b60-54e402c9ef3a "P47036")), both of whom were hired out to the university by James Nelson ([P47034](/en/people/e85d3366-b69d-4223-8603-0cd0ab7b7ecd "P47034")) for 40.00$ each (January 1, 1824), and 35.00$ each (January 4, 1825). Likely they were also the "2 hands" of James Nelson hired for 35.00$ on February 18, 1826. Humphry is also mentioned in an entry noting the payment of $37.50 to "[James Brockman](/en/people/e3e7c409-3191-4e9f-9fba-ca5d41e1c130 "BROCKMAN, JAMES") ([P47205](/en/people/e3e7c409-3191-4e9f-9fba-ca5d41e1c130 "P47205")) for hire of Humphry draft J.
