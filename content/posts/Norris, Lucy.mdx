"Lucy Norris," a photograph by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on April 23, 1912.

Note that [Vergie Norris](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1889 "Norris, Vergie") also had her potrait taken by Holsinger on April 23, 1912; the relation between Vergie and Lucy is not yet known.

Additional information about Lucy Norris will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._![Norris, Lucy](https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042020/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg "Norris, Lucy")
