The 1865 letter, "\[?\] To Aunt \[?\] March 8, 1865" details the Union Army’s occupation of Charlottesville, written by one of John B. Minor's ([P22874](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=22874 "P22874")) daughters (which one is to be determined) to an Aunt (which one also to be determined):

> Father ([P22874](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=22874 "P22874")) in the meantime, was intent on preserving the public property \[of the university\] & left us to shift for ourselves – very soon two stragglers appeared whose purpose was evidently to plunder, & if they had not been ‘so fearlessly confronted by cousin Nannie ([P48204](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48204 "P48204")), would have carried their point – She rose to the emergency, & presenting herself just as they were in close confront with Rachel ([P48415](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48415 "P48415")) demanded their business – They wanted to know where the man of the house was, if he had ever been in the army & if he had any arms, - on being told that Father was talking with their Genl. ([P48969](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=48969 "P48969")) they vanished – Not however, before they had secretly enquired of Rachel as to whether we had watches, to which she replied that she “didn’t know nothing I stay in the kitchen” -

More information about Rachel will be added as it is discovered.
