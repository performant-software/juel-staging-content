City Studio was an early photography studio that was in operation, along with [**Wampler****'s Studio**](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1125 "Wampler Photography Studio") ([CB1031](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=CB1031 "CB1031")), at the same time as Holsinger began University Studio in the early 1890's (exact date unknown). City Studio and Wampler's Studio were both bought out by Holsinger shortly after University Studio opened; the exact date is unknown, although City Studio was listed as open in the Charlottesville Business Directory of 1902. The exact dates of operation are not yet known. Address not yet known.
