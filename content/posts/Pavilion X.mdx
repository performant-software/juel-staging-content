Pavilion Servants

\- Early accounts (Faculty Minutes, Proctor's Daybook, Chairman's Journals) that mention a particular servant tied to a particular pavilion are infrequent (more common are references to Hotel servants, University employees). This makes sense given that the Pavilion servants were owned by the Professors and their families who occupied the Pavilions (so, refernece to them in the official university records would be sparse). In reading through the records you do get a sense of the complexities for the servants: some employed specifically by the university, others by the hotels (serving students), and others by the pavilions - how they took orders from (and were mistreated by/complained about by) students, answered to the Faculty and HotelKeepers and the governing bodies of the University, and also dealt with strangers from off-campus.

\- The records do suggest the Pavilion servants were entirely under the realm of the Professors for whom they worked (and that the Professors largely had control of the Pavilion in which they lived, yet still had to answer to the University which provided them the Pavilion building itself, which contained on the upper level the Professor's housing, the main level the lecture rooms, and the cellar the living quarters of the Pavilion servants). For example in the Chairman's Journal, Session 6, Prof. Blaetterman was chastised for letting someone stay in his Pavilion unofficially (without informing/getting approval).

Session 4  
1\. June 2, 1828: "A report was received from the Proctor [(P27585)](/en/people/7c15f776-0976-4b3f-8bcd-57b2c190e1c9), concerning the family of Phill, supposed to be a nuisance - also his monthly report on the state of the dormitories -referred."

Session 5

The Session 5 Journal (September 7, 1828 - July 20, 1829) is by Robley Dunglison (Chairman from 1825-6 and 1828-30), who lived at Pavilion X from 1825-33. 

\- The Chairman's Journal Session 5 and the Proctor's Daybook mentions by name the servant [Jack](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/681 "----, Jack") (adult male, last name unknown) (****[P47547](/en/people/a8823dc5-7704-4554-9544-8e5392275115 "P47547")****), who was one of a few hired by the university. The accounts of him throughout the Chairman's Journal mention the tasks he was expected to undertake, and for whom he was to work. The discussions seems to be about whether Jack worked in particular for the Proctor, A. S. Brockenborough, or more generally for the university. Based on the wording of the records, it appears that this was one and the same Jack being discussed. 

1\. January 1, 1827 entry in The Proctor's Daybook (by A. S. Brockenbrough): "Labour acct. draft Bills Payable for hire of the following laborers this year - Jack of A. S. Brockenbrough to attend about \[the\] Laboratory, Library, etc. - $50."

2\. October 11, 1828 entry in The Chairman's Journal (by Robley Dunglison): "Prof. Emmet complain regarding Laboratory Servant. Dr. Emmet [(P43625)](/en/people/380c50b5-e3c1-4a87-a607-83dac3879ba0) complained that he was unable to have the services of Jack [(P47547)](/en/people/a8823dc5-7704-4554-9544-8e5392275115) to clean out his Laboratory when he wished in consequence his being employed, according to Jack’s statement, in private personal attendance on Dr. Johnson [(P43633)](/en/people/71bcb0a1-252e-4ede-9842-e426a076d457). An Inquiry was made of the Proctor [(P43627)](/en/people/3cf66e55-3c68-473d-b75d-566f5acb7b79) concerning the matter who returned the following answer. The Proctor's answer to this complaint:

> 'Sir, In reply to your verbal communication of this morning, I beg leave to state I consider Jack [(P47547)](/en/people/a8823dc5-7704-4554-9544-8e5392275115) as hired to the University for this year and as the servant designated to attend on the Lecture Rooms, the Library etc. I have not called on or assigned to him any other business during the year. Dr Johnson has presently expressed a wish to have the services of Jack for the use of the Anat. Hall and for his own private use, he paying half the hire. I have always told him no arrangement of the sort could be entered into, until Jack’s place could be filled in attending on the Rotunda Lecture Rooms and Library - A Brockenbrough, P.'

3\. November 14, 1828 entry in The Chairman's Journal Session 5: "The Proctor [(P43627)](/en/people/3cf66e55-3c68-473d-b75d-566f5acb7b79) sent a note this morning complaining 'that the servant, Jack [(P47547)](/en/people/a8823dc5-7704-4554-9544-8e5392275115), could not perform his other Duties, if he had to call at all the different Pavilions for wood to make fires in the Lecture rooms' and desiring that the Faculty would make some arrangement on this subject by which the task could be easier performed. The Proctor was told to consider it as the duty of Jack to make the fire, but that the wood must be sent by the Professors themselves, until some further arrangement was made by the Faculty." 

Session 6  
1\. December 29, 1828 entry in The Chairman's Journal Session 6: "The Proctor [(P33020)](/en/people/f46e56ea-07dd-4652-8cf7-a751f39f6fba) contacted the Chairman [(P43624)](/en/people/f4611856-1ec5-42c1-9d79-b0cec3bd17b1) regarding the permitting of Tom[(P47184)](/en/people/306834c5-7163-4cd6-92bc-50819f73011b), a servant of Mr. Rose [(P43866)](/en/people/201889ef-5330-4cf2-b2c6-35d7bf311b96) to inhabit the cellars of one of the Hotels. It was considered right to refuse him.

2\. June 19, 1829 "Dr. Blaettermann [(P43621)](/en/people/079da1cb-8557-404a-a778-7d05727d78fe) has inhabited his house at the University but little for the last year or two and during his session he has given his rooms up to Students & is now about to let it to one not a Student – an object for which it was never intended & which may be the source of annoyance: as he manifestly claims the privilege of converting a Pavilion to any use which he pleases."

Session 7a  
1\. March 30, 1831: "Servants gambling. Servant, named Thornton[(P44757)](/en/people/fb45ee7f-766d-4f50-b001-f534a25407d7), who was whipped for theft, and turned away from the University, last session, was found by the Janitor, playing cards with Mrs. Gray's[(P43865)](/en/people/65c0fcb5-8795-4825-b850-2b641b15fb67)servant Albert[(P46978)](/en/people/6a7d24d7-440f-46ea-bd36-ab04fae61fb3), and Mr. Brockenbrough’s[(P43627)](/en/people/3cf66e55-3c68-473d-b75d-566f5acb7b79) man Trimpson[(P47794)](/en/people/a0d340de-542c-45ad-8281-ddc5a023c493). This affair was referred to the Proctor and Asst. Proctor.

2\.  March 20, 1831: "Mr. Conway appeared before the Chairman P.J. and complained of the injury done to his Premises & by Hogs – several of which he is informed by the Janitor are raised by the Servants of Individuals – officers of the Institution – the Fencing which has been put up by the Proctor is of no avail – stock have free ingress & egress to every part of the University."

Session 8

1\.  "June 25th 1832 Archibald Cary[(P41338)](/en/people/3bd7aa26-fbb6-4d35-a5b3-5ef36833ac91) complained that the boys of Dr. Blaettermann's family[(CB0898)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=CB0898) \[EVENT: General Misconduct  \] were so constantly engaged in playing on the violin that he was unable to study he said that on his complaining, they seemed to play more loudly & frequently and that he had applied to Dr. Blaettermann's[(P43621)](/en/people/079da1cb-8557-404a-a778-7d05727d78fe) himself for relief, but he had refused to interfere. He was told that the Faculty[(CB0105)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=CB0105)possessed no power over any member of their body and that so far as his complaint was well-founded, the Visitors[(CB0042)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=CB0042) alone were competent to remove the cause. It was though to be an aggravation of the nuisance that one of the boys was a negro who was receiving instructions in music[(P47347)](/en/people/74e86456-1c91-431d-bc5b-cd97f248adc8)." {evidence of Pavilion families alone being in control of their own servants\]. 

2\. May 8th. 1832 Robert C. Stanard[(P30132)](/en/people/2869d3b4-3400-428e-aff2-8c2e6aec74d8) applied for leave to use one of the upper rooms in Pavilion No. 7[(PL8462)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=PL8462) as a place of study, he finding it impracticable to study in consequence of the interruption experienced from Dr. Blaettermann[(P43621)](/en/people/079da1cb-8557-404a-a778-7d05727d78fe)'s little negroes[(CB0893)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=CB0893), his dormitory being next to Dr. B's pavilion[(PL8450)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=PL8450).

3\. March 27th 1832 The Proctor[(P43653)](/en/people/76024ae8-522b-43f9-9be5-b65a2c1331d2) was further required to give a general notice that the owners of negro children[(P47301)](/en/people/f6b535cc-65cb-4529-81f0-cdccf30b0da0)would be hereafter expected to prevent them from appearing on the lawn[(PL8427)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=PL8427), especially during the times of parade, except when sent on errands. They had been in the habit of collecting in groupes of a dozen or more, sometimes halfnaked.

Session 9

1\. February 13, 1833 - by Chairman George Tucker (Pavilon 9) "Last night the blinds of my office[(P43619)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_place?place=P43619) window had several bars broken out, & both then & the preceding night stones were thrown at the windows of one of cellar rooms occupied by my servants[(CB0882)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=CB0882). They told me they saw & heard two or three persons whom they took to be students, & the actors of the mischief. Attributed these repeated annoyances to those who had attempted to explode gunpowder at my window and who were probably irritated at the strong censures passed on their meditated mischief by the mass of students since the facts had come to their knowledge, I determined to address my class on the subject, and by appealing to their better feelings, to endeavour to induce them to take some active measures to discourage, if not prevent, the repetition of such outrages. I did so address them, and had the satisfaction to find that my appeal was very well received, & may be productive of good.

2\. September 19, 1832 - Dr. Dunglison[(P43624)](/en/people/f4611856-1ec5-42c1-9d79-b0cec3bd17b1) having suggested the \[EVENT: Epidemics  \] probability of the prevailing Cholera reaching this place, and the propriety of providing a hospital for the servants[(CB0874)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=CB0874) who may be attacked with it, I suggested the barn below the stable as the most suitable place, & he, the Proctor[(P43653)](/en/people/76024ae8-522b-43f9-9be5-b65a2c1331d2) & myself visited it for the purpose of judging of its fitness - \[EVENT: University Administration:Facilities Management  \] It was found to require considerable repairs, but with them, it was belived to be capable of accommodating 15 to 20 patients. The Proctor[(P43653)](/en/people/76024ae8-522b-43f9-9be5-b65a2c1331d2) was requested to have the hay in it removed, to have such repairs done as were necessary to keep out the weather - and to provide stores & the plank necessary for partitions, to be put up on a day's notice, in case the occasion should occur.

3\. September 20, 1832 - The Proctor[(P43653)](/en/people/76024ae8-522b-43f9-9be5-b65a2c1331d2) suggested to me that he thought Dr. Blattermann[(P43621)](/en/people/079da1cb-8557-404a-a778-7d05727d78fe)'s house on the hill \[EVENT: Epidemics  \] could be procured for a cholera hospital, if needed, and that \[EVENT: University Administration:Facilities Management  \] it would at once cost less money to fit up than the barn, and be better suited to the purpose - in which I concurred, & requested him to make an agreement for it.

4\. September 24, 1832 - The Proctor[(P43653)](/en/people/76024ae8-522b-43f9-9be5-b65a2c1331d2) informed me that he had not only agreed with the tenant of Mr. Blattermann[(P43621)](/en/people/079da1cb-8557-404a-a778-7d05727d78fe)'s house on the hill \[EVENT: Epidemics  \] that it should be used as a hospital if wanted, but that its present occupants - free negroes - had also agreed to act as nurses & attendants, which arrangement was altogether satisfactory.

Session 10

1\. October 1, 1833: "Mr. H Tomlin[(P43725)](/en/people/9810c836-d6a0-45e7-b9ba-090060f2d0b9) called at my office and complained of the system of espionage used towards him by the Proctor[(P43653)](/en/people/76024ae8-522b-43f9-9be5-b65a2c1331d2). Stated that Jones, a man employed by the Proctor[(P43653)](/en/people/76024ae8-522b-43f9-9be5-b65a2c1331d2) in the woodyard, was employed to watch him -- complained that Mr Pendleton[(P43653)](/en/people/76024ae8-522b-43f9-9be5-b65a2c1331d2) was to him in consequence of the report made on the 14th of Sept. complained of Mr Pendleton[(P43653)](/en/people/76024ae8-522b-43f9-9be5-b65a2c1331d2) coming to the neighbourhood of his room at night; and added that Jones had cooked in at his window -- asked whether he had a night to prevent such intrusion on the part of a person not an officer of the Institution."

Session 11  
  
There were University servants, separate from the hotel servants and pavilion servants. 

1\. July 11, 1835. "I directed servants Lewis[(P47783)](/en/people/1aca339e-0991-444d-8fd3-9ad521888b75) & Jack[(P47784)](/en/people/d20233e3-3ad1-4599-9339-e3187f82ee42), who have heretofore had holyday during the vacation, though their labors are very light during the session, to go to work with the other University servants."   

2\. August 27, 1835. "I took this occasion also to suggest to the Proctor[(CB0249)](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_cb?cb=CB0249) in a manner as little offensive as possible, the propriety of abstaining from every unauthorised use of the University property, & of keeping his own distinct from it; and in particular, I recommended to him, to keep his horses in his own stable. He has heretofore kept them in the University stable & had them attended to by its servant & at its expense; & not only have his own been so kept, but those of all persons visiting him; for all which he has only charged himself $50 for the horse employed in hauling wood to the students, & with that sum, only for the last year, as I understand. If my recommendation be not attended to, I shall consider it my duty imperatively to require to be done what I have thought it best now only to advise." (Example of the distinction between University servants and Professors' own servants)

Session 12

1.  April 11, 1836. "So much of the day would have passed before he usually comes out, that no wagons could have been obtained to day. The Janitor[(P43949)](/en/people/ad8cfcd9-d844-4b32-bce7-703a9eec4d19)succeeded in engaging two; one of which commenced work immediately, & the other will commence tomorrow. I also put my own to hauling wood to the students." (J. A. G. Davis regarding his own servants being put to use).
