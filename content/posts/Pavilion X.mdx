<p>Pavilion Servants</p><p>- Early accounts (Faculty Minutes, Proctor's Daybook, Chairman's Journals) that mention a particular servant tied to a particular pavilion are infrequent (more common are references to Hotel servants, University employees). This makes sense given that the Pavilion servants were owned by the Professors and their families who occupied the Pavilions (so, refernece to them in the official university records would be sparse). In reading through the records you do get a sense of the complexities for the servants: some employed specifically by the university, others by the hotels (serving students), and others by the pavilions - how they took orders from (and were mistreated by/complained about by) students, answered to the Faculty and HotelKeepers and the governing bodies of the University, and also dealt with strangers from off-campus.</p><p>- The records do suggest the Pavilion servants were entirely under the realm of the Professors for whom they worked (and that the Professors largely had control of the Pavilion in which they lived, yet still had to answer to the University which provided them the Pavilion building itself, which contained on the upper level the Professor's housing, the main level the lecture rooms, and the cellar the living quarters of the Pavilion servants). For example in the Chairman's Journal, Session 6, Prof. Blaetterman was chastised for letting someone stay in his Pavilion unofficially (without informing/getting approval).</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Session 4<br /></span>1.

The accounts of him throughout the Chairman's Journal mention the tasks he was expected to undertake, and for whom he was to work. The discussions seems to be about whether Jack worked in particular for the Proctor, A. S. Brockenborough, or more generally for the university. Based on the wording of the records, it appears that this was one and the same Jack being discussed.&nbsp;</p><p>1. January 1, 1827 entry in The Proctor's Daybook (by A. S.
