Stephen Coram was a freed man of colour who lived in the area surrounding the university. He is mentioned in the [John Hartwell Cocke papers](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/minishowcase2/ "John Hartwell Cocke Papers") in a discussion between [John Hartwell Cocke](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/648 "JOHN HARTWELL COCKE") ([P43616](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=43616 "P43616")) and Alexander Garrett about the purchase of property once owned by [Robert Battles](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/717 "Robert Battles") ([P47363](http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/public_person?person=47365 "P47365")). Garrett writes, "I fear you are too late in urging Nelson to make the purchase of the mulattos who hold the remainder of Battles’s original lot, I know you did desire Nelson to make the purchase. . . yet I understood from Dinsmore on yesterday, that he had purchased Coram out; (Coram you will recollect holds one acre at the upper end of the lot opposite Dinsmore’s gate) whether it is on his own account or for you I cannot positively say . . ." (c. 1825).
