Holsinger taken on April 23, 1912.</p><p>Information about a Vergie Norris can be found in the J. F. Bell Funeral Home Database; it may or may not be the same person as seen in the portrait below: "Vergie (Norris) Murray, born October 27, 1901 in Rockingham, West Virginia to parents Cuffie Norris and Cornelia Tyrell; spouse Curtis Murray and daughter Annie Mae Oliver of New York City; died December 31 1976 at Towers Hospital, Charlottesville Va. and buried in Oakwood Cemetery."</p><p>This biographical information is also confirmed in the following database entry about&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1796" target="_blank" title="Norris, Fannie">Fannie Norris</a>&nbsp;(who was also photographed by Holsinger on May 5, 1912): "Fannie (Norris) Bell, born March 18, 1893 in Rockingham County Virginia to parents Cuffey Norris and Cornelia Terrell Norris; spouse Thomas Bell; died April 2, 1973; place of death&nbsp;354 11th St. NW Charlottesville, Va. and buried in Oakwood Cemetery; son James Leroy Norris, Kingston, NY; sister <strong>Virgie Murray</strong>."</p><p>It is quite likely that Vergie's sister is Fannie Norris (despite small discrepancies in the two entries - such as the variant in the mother's maiden name as Tyrell/Terrell).</p><p>Additionally,&nbsp;note that&nbsp;<a href="http://juel.iath.virginia.edu/node/1888" target="_blank" title="Norris, Lucy">Lucy Norris</a>&nbsp;also had her potrait taken by Holsinger on April 23, 1912; the relation between Vergie and Lucy is not yet known.</p><p>Additional information about Vergie Norris will be added as it is researched.</p><p><em>NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger).</em><img src="https://iiif.lib.virginia.edu/iiif/uva-lib:1042021/full/1000,1337/0/default.jpg" alt="Norris, Vergie" title="Norris, Vergie" width="1000" height="1337" />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><span class="text_exposed_show">"<a href="https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1042021#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=376%2C581%2C1314%2C974" target="_blank" title="Norris, Vergie">Vergie Norris</a>," 1912-04-23 photograph in UVA Library Catalogue (X02244A)&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong>:</p><p><a href="http://rwholsingerphotos.org/images.php" target="_blank" title="Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans">Holsinger Image Gallery of African Americans</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/afam/raceandplace/perl_scripts/funeral_search.html" target="_blank" title="J.
