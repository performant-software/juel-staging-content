"Lacy Miller," three photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on August 24, 1914.

The first two (as seen below) show the woman photographed by herself, while the third is a portrait of two children, with what appears to be her arm steadying the infant. Likely she is the nanny or nurse of the children. Her name may be Lacy Miller, or, that may be the name of her employer (the portraits are labelled by the name of whomever paid for the potrait).

Additional information about Lacy Miller will be added as it is researched.  

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
