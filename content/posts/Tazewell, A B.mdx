"A. B. Tazewell," two photographs by Rufus W. Holsinger taken on June 14, 1912.  
  
The young woman in the second photograph below wears a locket necklace as well as a unique brooch (that appears to be of a bulldog face).

Additional information about A. B. Tazewell, the subjects photographed, and the possible relation between the subjects will be added as it is researched. 

_NOTE that the name with which the portrait is labelled (or, labelled "untitled") is not necessarily the name of the sitter(s) in the portrait, but rather the name of the person who paid for the portrait when it was taken (the date and name associated with each photograph is from the business ledgers of R. W. Holsinger)._
